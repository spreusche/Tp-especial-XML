If the AV site crashes and burns, that's a discussion for then and not now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Second, it would be bizarre and confusing for AVP to cover non-music audio and for us to cover recording music.  There's a huge overlap in the techniques, technology, etc. and there's no reason that people with expertise in recording audio shouldn't be able to talk about recording music.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While it's true that many musicians have recorded music and have expertise in that area, I would expect audio engineers who record music for a living to have greater expertise.  A much larger group with expertise in recording music should be present at the AVP site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And, while it's true that many musicians may have questions about recording their music, StackExchange makes it easy to direct them to the Audio site.  Moderators can also easily migrate questions to that site.  A large proportion of AVP users will be able to answer their questions, as opposed to the small proportion of musicians who have done serious audio production.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also disagree with others who think music recording, or apects of it, should be on-topic on both sites.  That makes for confusion and a division of expertise.  There's also no clear line between the audio-engineer-technical-aspects and the musicality-aspects, and drawing one would be likely to alienate people.

For the latter case, some questions about bass sound/technique may be applicable to both bass guitar and double-bass. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If one was playing an acoustic bass guitar, should one then use &quot;acoustic bass guitar,&quot; &quot;acoustic&quot; and &quot;bass guitar&quot; as two tags, or &quot;acoustic,&quot; &quot;bass,&quot; and &quot;guitar&quot; as three separate tags?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As you can see, this can get all kinds of confusing, and I'm wondering if there is a standard that the community has agreed upon, and if so, what is it?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="64" LastEditorUserId="48" LastEditDate="2011-05-10T07:25:16.447" LastActivityDate="2014-02-18T17:53:10.607" Title="Instrument tagging standards" Tags="&lt;discussion&gt;&lt;tags&gt;" AnswerCount="4" CommentCount="0" FavoriteCount="1" />

If a tag only make sense in the context of another tag, it is not appropriate. So using &quot;bass&quot; as a short name for the double bass in the viol family is okay, but using &quot;bass&quot; as a modifier for another instrument (&quot;bass&quot; &quot;clarinet&quot;, &quot;bass&quot; &quot;saxophone&quot;, &quot;bass&quot; &quot;guitar&quot;) is not good. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In your case you may want to tag &quot;bass-guitar&quot; (replace all spaces by dashes, since spaces are not allowed in tag names). If you have an acoustic bass guitar question, I would suggest tagging it both &quot;bass-guitar&quot; and &quot;acoustic-guitar&quot;.

This is why &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/11740/what-are-community-wiki-posts&quot;&gt;posts are automatically made CW after 10 edits or after being edited by 5 users&lt;/a&gt;.  Posts should be &lt;em&gt;manually&lt;/em&gt; marked CW when intention is to have this collaborative editing.  This is normally done to questions, to ensure all of its answers will be CW.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Community Wiki posts stop giving reputation (due to upvotes) to the original poster once they are made CW.  When you have 90% of the content from a post coming from other community members, for example, why would you want rep going to only one of them?  CW neatly solves this problem.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is why CW is bad for opinions, recommendations, and list questions&lt;/strong&gt;.  If someone provides a useful opinion on an aspect of music theory or recommends a method of practice, they &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; get reputation points if others find it useful!  Those do not need to be collaboratively edited, and neither do lists; a new poster will just add a new list item as a separate answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Examples of Good Community Wiki Questions&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/11740/what-are-community-wiki-posts&quot;&gt;What are &quot;Community Wiki&quot; posts?&lt;/a&gt;  (Meta Stack Overflow)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This post is a good example because the nature, purpose, and application of Community Wiki has been repeatedly revised.

  <row Id="124" PostTypeId="2" ParentId="2" CreationDate="2011-05-13T10:14:56.510" Score="7" Body="&lt;p&gt;One of the notational service available via the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.songtrellis.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SongTrellis site&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a Tunetext service, which accepts properly encoded markup  and produces a MIDI performance and matching score expressed as a JPG image. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A Tunetext  page, which the service returns in response to a request,  performs the generated MIDI sequence, displays the score on the page, and provides links which package that music in a number of  ways so that it can be posted on other websites. Think of this page as a factory for producing music examples.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When a musical example is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.songtrellis.com/publicIdeas/5-13-2011%28Friday%29.html#5/13/11;3:43:01AM&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;packaged as a tunetext button&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the score image is displayed within a frame with the instruction &quot;Click on music to play&quot; located  below the bottom edge of the frame. The tunetext URL that generated that music is attached as a link to the score image. When the score image is clicked, the music plays and is displayed in entirety within its response page. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By pressing the &quot;Edit Tunetext Parameters&quot; button that appears on a Tunetext response page, a visitor can customize the example for their own purposes (change the tempo, alter the instrumentation, generate color coded scores to label the harmonic or melodic intervals formed by notes and chords in the score).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Such buttons cannot be posted to StackExchange at this moment because usage of the Embed HTML tag is not currently allowed, but it might be reasonable to ask Stack Exchange developers for a way to submit such buttons to the site, if members believe they would be valuable to post.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The notation of the music is available for a viewer to manipulate for their own purposes. The music they produce by their alterations they can save for themselves and can post elsewhere. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tunetext is especially suited for generating example harmony extremely quickly. When  chords are specified in the markup using only chord names like this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cmi7(b5),F7Alt,Bmi(MA7)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;the Tunetext interpreter will automatically generate  voicing for that  chord list. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/iQSpKS&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Click here to perform those chords&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here's the score image harvested from that Tunetext page:&#xA;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.songtrellis.com/excerptstor/tunetextpool/Example%205-13-11/Example5-13-11E110513032058.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you issued the URL &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.songtrellis.com/tunetext&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.songtrellis.com/tunetext&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;with no following parameters, a form would launch where you could type these or other chord symbols. When you press the &quot;Submit Score&quot; button in this form, the specified music will be performed and the score for that music  will be displayed&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If it's necessary to precisely specify the voicing for a chord, a list of pitch specifications enclosed in square brackets is written after the chord name, like this: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;DMA7[3,d,4,d,f#,a,5,d]  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.songtrellis.com/tunetext?text=chords%3a%28DMA7%5b3,d,4,d,f%23,a,5,d%5d%29&amp;amp;title=stackex2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Click here to perform&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The integers in the list specify the octave ranges where the immediately placed pitches will be placed on the staff. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The tunetext interpreter treats durations as a property of the notes, chords and rests that are being added to a score. Once a duration has been set for a note, chord or rest, it's not necessary to respecify the  duration for following elements that have the same duration. The default duration assumed  at the beginning of a specification is whole note duration. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When a change of duration must be made for a following chord (or note or rest), a scaling factor is applied to transform the previously used duration value into the duration required of the new note. For example, a /2 operator means to divide the previously by 2.  The *3 operator means to multiply the previously used duration by 3. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This specification&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cmi7(b5),F7Alt,*2,Bmi(MA7) &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/kmjOMf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Click here to perform&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;would play Cmi7(b5) then F7Alt as whole note chords and then would double the duration of the Bmi(MA7) chord. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here's a four chord sequence expressed as a Tunetext URL: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.songtrellis.com/tunetext?text=show:0,sys:0,chords:%28inst:1,C7,D7,E7,F%237%28%2311%29%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://www.songtrellis.com/tunetext?text=show:0,sys:0,chords:%28inst:1,C7,D7,E7,F%237%28%2311%29%29&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here's &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/m7kWqP&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a melody improvised above these chords&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; using pitch rules that are part of the Tunetext language. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here's the score image harvested from the Tunetext page for that melody: &lt;img src=&quot;http://www.songtrellis.com/excerptstor/tunetextpool/Example%205-9-11/Example5-9-11Ex110513031848.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I should mention that I'm the developer of the SongTrellis site and its Tunetext service.

They are small objects, so storing and serving them costs a web site little in storage and data transmission site. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;MP3s are a thousand times larger, so they are a thousand times more expensive to use as examples along both cost dimensions. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;MIDI sequences are easily editable, so that a MIDI example can be customized in many ways, so that it can serve as  seed material for the practice, composing, improvising or study that a musician is doing.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;MP3s have much better fidelity and sound quality which makes listening to them a more musical experience. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But their great disadvantage is that it is very difficult to reach into such objects and affect only one of the constituent parts of the recording that have been mixed together. Changing the pitch of even one note in MP3 performance is a major technical undertaking. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Musically speaking, for the production of new music, mp3s are most valuable for sampling and various forms of collaging, techniques that don't lend themselves easily to the practicing, composing and improvising skills that musicians are trying to exercise and improve. It is possible to analyze and intuit the way a piece of music develops from direct listening to a performance, but this skill is slow to develop and remains an occult art for many musicians. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is relatively easy and extremely quick process to transform a MIDI representation of a musical passage into a readable score, which is the object that most musicians need to perfect their performance of a composition, to study the harmonic and melodic construction of a piece so that they can profit from knowledge of a composer's ideas and do likewise, and to use as a musical ratchet tool so that they can preserve their own musical ideas so that they don't dissolve into oblivion.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Given the utility of MIDI sequences, shouldn't we have a way to post MIDI sequences to music.stackexchange and play them within the site's Q&amp;amp;A's?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The big technical impediment for playing MIDI sequences and music examples recorded using other formats is that they are performed using the EMBED construct in HTML.

Are these questions acceptable at all?  The answer is sometimes.  Below are some guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Opinions&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;As a general rule, questions should not solicit opinions. They should solicit &lt;strong&gt;facts&lt;/strong&gt;.  This is not to say that answers cannot contain opinions!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, this is bad:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;I think I should learn more about harmony so I can write better songs.  What do you think?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But this is good:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;I am considering learning more about harmony to improve my song writing.  In what ways can studying harmony help me as a songwriter? Has anyone experienced a change in their composition after studying harmony, and can you explain what changed and why?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the first question, no one really knows what you're looking for.  You're just asking to get answers that say &quot;You should totally learn harmony :)&quot; instead of actual useful information.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The answers to the second question will still have opinions, but with a twist: &quot;You should totally learn harmony, &lt;strong&gt;because&lt;/strong&gt;...&quot;.  What follows will, hopefully, consist of facts (which can be objectively evaluated) stemming from the answerer's knowledge and experience.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you truly just want general ideas thrown around, try heading over to &lt;a href=&quot;http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/440/musical-practice-and-performance&quot;&gt;the chatroom&lt;/a&gt;.  But answers on the site should have facts so you know whose opinion to value!  And questions should be constructed purposefully to bring out this kind of answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Questioners, ask detailed questions requesting facts.  Answerers, provide detailed answers where your opinion is backed up with fact.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Generally speaking, recommendations in answers should be treated like opinions in answers: make sure you add facts.  Tell the asker why you recommend something with cold, hard facts (more than just &quot;because I like it&quot;).  Questions can be a bit different, though.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If your question starts with &quot;What is a good&quot; or &quot;What is the best&quot;, stop right there.  You may have found yourself writing a bad question.  Consider the shopping recommendation:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;What's the best guitar to buy for playing rock songs?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's a whole bunch more information we need, here, including the following:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;What's your budget?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Where do you live?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Are you willing to buy online?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;What subset of rock music are you interested in playing?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Do you want to look cool or just sound good?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And on and on.  Providing that much detail in a question, some of it personal, is a bit ridiculous.  And once you did, the question would be too localized!  The answers would apply only to you and be largely useless for anyone else.  Fortunately, there's a much better question you can ask:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;How can I evaluate whether a guitar is good for playing rock songs?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The answers to that question should be useful to anyone wanting to play rock songs, and the ideal answer would discuss many aspects of what affects a guitar's sound and the like.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's important to note that almost all of the problems with shopping recommendations apply to all recommendations.  Whether it's free or something you don't shop for at all, you should be asking &quot;How can I solve my problem?&quot; and not &quot;What's the best X?&quot;  From the &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.stackexchange.com/faq&quot;&gt;FAQ&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;If your motivation for asking the question is &quot;I would like to participate in a discussion about &lt;code&gt;______&lt;/code&gt;&quot;, then you should not be asking here.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;  If your motivation is &quot;I would like others to explain &lt;code&gt;______&lt;/code&gt; to me&quot;, then you are probably OK.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Lists&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;List questions are generally just recommendations in disguise.  A bad disguise.  List questions generally take the form &quot;What are some X?&quot; or &quot;What is a good resource for Y?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;List questions are so-called because they result in the answers being an &lt;strong&gt;itemized list&lt;/strong&gt;.  Often they'll receive 10 or more one-line answers that have no explanation.  If you find that useful, that's up to you.  But it is certainly not useful to the community as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As with all questions, &lt;strong&gt;there should be clear, specific criteria for evaluating answers&lt;/strong&gt;.  Do not ask for a good resource.  Ask for a resource that provides exactly what you're looking for.  Better yet, as above, &lt;strong&gt;ask how to solve your problem&lt;/strong&gt;!  For example, don't ask the following:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Is there a website where I can learn advanced harmony?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That will get you terrible answers -- &quot;Yes&quot; or a link with little explanation.  Instead, you should ask:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Having learned basic harmony theory via [method], how can I learn more advanced concepts I haven't covered?  Ideally I would like to learn [topic] and be able to do [something] by the end, and I'd like something I can do in my own time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Someone might well answer that second question with a link to a website, but they will be encouraged to go further.  A good answer would address your specific concerns and provide alternatives that you may not have considered.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="28" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:41:38.193" LastActivityDate="2011-11-03T17:14:17.320" CommentCount="0" />

It's not &lt;em&gt;super&lt;/em&gt; important, since we can make one a synonym of the other, but the one we choose should be the one that comes most naturally to the most members of the community balanced with the need to attract new members.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Small note: As an intermediate guitarist myself, I use and much prefer &quot;whammy bar&quot;.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="28" LastEditorUserId="28" LastEditDate="2011-05-28T03:10:54.860" LastActivityDate="2011-05-28T14:28:11.337" Title="How should we tag questions about whammy bars?"

First off, I'm not really sure what that means, so an elaboration on that would be nice--but in particular if we are to enforce the driving logic behind closing questions like the one linked then all questions related to the specifics of some gear (guitar electronics, amp design, effects design, pedalboard design, ad nauseum) should be closed as well. I could argue that circuit design on a Stratocaster is electrical engineering, and consequently belongs on physics.SE, etcetera. The distinction between subject matter inside a broader topic is best handled by tags, not closings. It just so happens that circuit design and a good bit of eMag are very heavily utilized subject matter when designing and describing amplifiers, electric guitars, and guitar effects.

Please review their FAQ and ask your question there, &lt;em&gt;if appropriate!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm going to agree with Grace here.  First let's look at our Area 51 definition:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;h1&gt;Musical Practice and Performance&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;h3&gt;Beta Q&amp;amp;A site for musicians, students, and enthusiasts. Topics include practice &amp;amp; performance, composition, technique, theory, and history.&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Obviously that puts the focus squarely on the art of creating music.  History is really the only grey area &amp;mdash; if we allow questions about the great composers of the past, do those questions have to be related to their music?  And to what degree?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think we've largely agreed that the focus of all questions here should be music or its production.  For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/43/should-we-allow-questions-about-legal-issues&quot;&gt;legal issues are off-topic&lt;/a&gt;.  Despite clearly being relevant to musicians and consumers of music, these questions are off-topic because the focus is on law, ehich that happens to be related to music.  The converse (music related to law) would clearly be on-topic, though I doubt there is much music written about law :P&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, consider the generic question &quot;Can I legally download copyrighted X without permission or payment?&quot;  Whether X is &quot;music&quot; or &quot;games&quot; or something else, the answer doesn't really change, and it requires legal expertise &amp;mdash; not musical expertise &amp;mdash; to answer.  Conversely, &quot;Will X help my guitar playing?  Why?&quot; is about playing guitar &lt;em&gt;no matter what X is&lt;/em&gt;.  Questions like that require musical expertise to answer and are what we're looking for on this site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now let's form the generic version of your question:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Do people who learn X of any kind like to show it to others?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To answer this question, the knowledge you need is simply the number X-learners who like to show their skills to others (statistics).  This information would be created via a psychological study, since &quot;well I know a few X-learners and I would say sort of&quot; is not a good answer.  Nowhere is expertise on learning X required; no matter what X is, the question can be answered perfectly well by anyone with the information, and that person is most likely to be a statistician or a psychologist.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you were to ask it on a statistics or psychology StackExchange site, however, I believe it would be closed for other reasons.  There appears to be no real rationale for the question beyond curiosity; SE's FAQ says questions must be about actual, practical problems.  Second, the answer to your question is &quot;Some people sometimes&quot;.  There are a vast number of musicians in the world, with all sorts of situations and backgrounds.  Some will love performing, some will hate it; some will take the attention for granted and not improve, others will be inspired, others will retreat from it.

I have no clue how i can produce my music in this way. If he does not have this effect he will buy it, and so do i... I know this isn't 100% comparable but it should give an impression of how i am feeling.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.stackexchange.com/users/1678/luke&quot;&gt;Luke&lt;/a&gt; agrees with me to be on topic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I'm also sad about the down-voting on a well formatted post with a clear question structure and a big description without commenting... But this happens in other stackexchange network sites too...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm writing here, because I want my post be re-opened again!

For example, I wanted to know about laptop batteries since mine died. I didn't now want to know about which was better than the other, but rather give me the information as to waht to look for in a good battery.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;and that is my point. I'm not interested in the best software. I am interested if there is such software! I mean for sure there have to be some, but i do not know it and want to know some... I'm asking here to get help to find some... Because if I am unable to name my software or can get information about the type here, i can't google etc. for it...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;This is the main root, in my opinion, as to why shopping questions are so strictly monitored and closed.

Maybe i did not found the right description in a foreign language but i think my question brings a growth!

One important rationale for this is that SE questions should be enduring, or future-proof, and helpful to people who search the question later. In 2 years, there could be a completely different software landscape, and any answers that helped at the time you asked would be irrelevant to the future viewer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would also guess that some of the downvotes are related to the clarity of the question itself. It's very broad, and not quite clear if you just want to burn the tracks that you already have to CD, actually produce brand-new tracks from scratch, or something in-between. Also, some of the supporting material you provide is not really relevant--the different ways in which 32-bar segments can be put together is not going to dictate your software decision.

A good question would provide sufficient context around the sonority (printed or aural) to allow a detailed answer.  (The linked question does not currently meet this criterion.)  This way, it is not necessary for those answering to find a score or a recording for themselves.

I think part of it may be the nature of the topic &amp;mdash; it's quite normal to run into a new programming problem every day, but not likely to have a new practice/performance problem.  As individuals we could certainly look into a new area of theory we haven't before, for example; that would provide a good source of questions.  But in the long run that isn't sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Our number of &quot;active users&quot; is slightly inflated due to the Guitars merge, since it actually counts rep and not current activity, though I don't know the exact numbers.  Since users drive questions I think it may actually be the user department where we are suffering.  Our stats about answering are great, and I think we have a number of experts, so the questions I would ask are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can we attract new users, paricularly beginners?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can we keep new users coming back to the site and asking questions as they progress?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That assumes that the new users are constructive conributors. However, a substantial portion of new users come here asking for recommendations, &quot;what's your favorite song&quot;, etc.  While there are certain classes of questions we've decided are off-topic but could potentially be made on-topic one day, those kinds of questions aren't constructive and just aren't doable on Stack Exchange at a fundamental level.  So they're going to be closed, which leads to another question:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can we ensure poor-fit questions are closed without discouraging people?

At present, I do not believe there is enough reason to extend our scope to include that topic.

My question though is; really, who is going to care to look at a closed question to see if it has become reopenable? I'm thinking that once a question has been closed it is sort of doomed, even if the asker improves the question, since it will get so few views being marked as closed, and thus slim chances of receiving reopen votes. Am I wrong? Could anything be done, site-functionality-wise or by the hands of the asker, to increase the chances of reopening of a reworked question?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(The example that got me wondering is this question where the asker did make an effort to clarify the intent of the question but I'm in doubt that it will ever receive enough reopen attention (unless this meta question changes it's chances, but that is not the point of this meta question):&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;https://music.stackexchange.com/questions/7802/learning-another-instrument&quot;&gt;Learning another instrument?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Will @EmmaHagreen ever have her question reopened?

All questions that have any re-open votes on them will be sent to the queue and those with enough rep can review whether or not they should be re-opened. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The second way is via the moderator tools (available to all 2K+users). In there is a list of the questions with the most recent reopen votes and the questions with the most reopen votes. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With these two tools, mods and high-rep users can see these questions and either vote to reopen or let it stay closed. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As to your specific example, I saw it in the re-open queue and have voted to re-open it. However, only &lt;del&gt;two&lt;/del&gt; three of our 98 eligible users have ever used that queue, which is a dilemma. It is a known problem that it is hard to reopen a question, but that might be &quot;status by design&quot;. My guess is that the mods have seen the question and think it is still to ambiguous.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note, it is fine to request a question be reopened here on meta. That's what meta is for. If you wish to discuss this specific question further, rather than reopening in general, either make a new question or edit this one to clarify.

I am here to check in on the site and see if there’s any way the team from Stack Exchange can help you improve it. Note that this is a more hands-on, site-by-site and case-by-case basis evaluation, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; related to the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://music.meta.stackexchange.com/q/362/28&quot;&gt;Quality&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/415/music-self-evaluation-lets-get-critical&quot;&gt;Evaluations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; already done on this and other sites.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We’ve started keeping an eye on certain metrics and now after a couple months of tracking the data, we have a few areas that we think Music.SE can improve in. Here are the two areas that have caught our attention:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Between October and November, your visitors per day has dropped from 2600 to 2412&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Between October and November, your questions per day has dropped from 2.6 to 2.4&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I know those may not seem like big dips, but there’s no reason we can’t work towards improving them. The site is actually &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; a little below average compared to other sites near its age, and I think it can be pushed to &lt;em&gt;above&lt;/em&gt; average with a little bit of attention paid to these two areas. Here are some resources and ideas for enabling improvement:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;To improve visitors per day, try sharing your questions via other social media sites you use (click on the “share” button below any question). There is a badge for sharing that can be awarded multiple times: the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://music.stackexchange.com/badges/59/announcer&quot;&gt;Announcer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; badge. We can start a contest wherein users who get the Announcer badge get a prize.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;To improve the number of questions asked per day, we can start hosting &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://scifi.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1138/topic-of-the-week-contest-updated-august-29&quot;&gt;Topic of the Week&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; events, where tags are chosen by the community and any questions within that tag during a set period of time are eligible for a prize.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We are relying on you, the core user community, to decide whether or not either of these ideas are worth implementing. If so, we will spearhead the effort! You have our attention and also a modest budget with which to launch some of these initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you want to do an &lt;strong&gt;Announcer badge reward&lt;/strong&gt;, or start a &lt;strong&gt;Topic of the Week campaign&lt;/strong&gt;, please leave an answer saying so!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If any core users of Music.SE have &lt;strong&gt;any other ideas&lt;/strong&gt; for improving on these metrics, &lt;strong&gt;please leave an answer to this meta post&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, we know you are excited about the potential for our sites but please keep this meta post focused on things you, as the collective community, can do as opposed to feature requests or larger branding campaigns.

The Question you refer to is &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.stackexchange.com/q/9947/2125&quot;&gt;Is there a set of guidelines to indicate where on the neck to play equivalent notes?&lt;/a&gt;, and the edit was to render the title as &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.stackexchange.com/posts/9947/revisions&quot;&gt;Mandolin: Is there a set of guidelines to indicate where on the neck to play equivalent notes?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'd say that in this case the inclusion of the name of the instrument, or some narrowing feature, is important.

I think we'll have trouble hitting the threshold until this picks up - simply to be able to get enough questions per day. The upside is we are growing, slowly, and as the SE devs remind us we can stay in beta for an extended period, as long as it looks like we can keep growing.

In remembering back to those times, the core things the entire community did was to tell their friends, encourage posts on bulletin boards and forums and generally encourage people to come and check it out. A large number of those people in security also use computers as part of their day job - so it is easy to get them involved here. A large number are active across the Stack Exchange network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Music we have a small core of active users, almost all of whom are active elsewhere on Stack Exchange, and then a much larger number of occasional visitors who have no other SE accounts. These feel to me like non-IT folks, so our challenge here is how we make this site as welcoming as possible to them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think our scope is correct (despite the occasional post suggesting we allow 'who is this singer' type questions) - but can we target music schools or music theory and practice courses at colleges and universities, maybe? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, everyone &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.meta.stackexchange.com/q/123/104&quot;&gt;follow the StackMusic twitter&lt;/a&gt; account and retweet good tweets!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="104" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:41:38.193" LastActivityDate="2013-08-30T20:50:36.640" CommentCount="4" />

Though many would disagree, I am also active in TeX-SX which is relatively a bigger one compared to here and there is a familiar pattern from the early days that there is no flexibility on the rules. I agree that without moderation it would be a disaster but too much of it is equally hurtful.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Every potential nice/fun question is closed with downvotes which is scaring new users away and making the site very dull (my personal opinion). With dullness, I mean only chord progression, instrument maintenance and a few other recurring themes. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As an example, we have almost unanimously dropped the use of downvotes in TeX-SX. It doesn't serve any purpose outside SO and there things are ridiculously hostile. And we have the highest voting users over the whole network. Rep points are useless and we use it as mark as read to be honest (at least that's what I'm doing).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't understand how something like music is so boring when it comes to Music-SX. I know everyone is dying to tell me about the difference between a forum and a Q&amp;amp;A but I emphasize I am familiar with the format (check my profile if really an evidence is needed). A discussion does not need to be a &lt;em&gt;post under post&lt;/em&gt;, it can be different answers covering different aspects of the topic plus we can use the community-wiki option extensively instead of downvoting and closing questions. Otherwise this SX is destined to stay like a lonely 5-star intercity hotel. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't think I have to repeat that these are my &lt;em&gt;personal&lt;/em&gt; thoughts, that doesn't have to be correct or accurate. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerDisplayName="user1306" LastEditorUserId="8682" LastEditDate="2014-05-27T10:22:06.907" LastActivityDate="2014-05-27T10:22:06.907" CommentCount="15" />

To deal effectively with the code they implemented &lt;a href=&quot;http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt; in their editor, an awesome software solution that allows typing crystal-clear reading content on the run, without effort, where code is easily distinguishable from regular words. Mathematics SE's site also needs a special software solution, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mathjax.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;MathJax&lt;/a&gt;, to make possible typing and rendering complex mathematical language on the go. You all know this, of course, but I wanted to bring it up to see how those assumed situations would apply to our music site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We are dealing with music, a complex and many-sided subject that is dramatically different in it's nature to any other subjects from the other SE sites. The differences are mainly about the way our Q&amp;amp;A matter manifests in real life and about what kind of people is involved with it. Music is essentially sound, and a part of music is also usually written down with special notation. Music is also deeply involved with human nature itself, so as a discipline it will be necessarily related with people of all kinds, both aficionados and professionals. This is normal because many different people make music. That sets a difference with other SE sites that deal with maths, physics or programming. It's not common that some friends meet after work in a garage to do some rock out on partial derivative exercises. But making music just for fun, aside whatever other profession you work on, is common indeed. So it's natural that beginner questions and expert questions happen in this site in a way that differs from other sites.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I discovered this site short time ago and became really excited about what an awesome goldmine of music knowledge this could be. I'm also aware of the problems this site has got today. I've read and thought about many meta questions about those problems, linked below, that deal with different considerations about how to improve this site. And I came up with conclusions that really make sense to me, which can be summarized in this statement: &lt;strong&gt;in my opinion, the main problem this music site has is that it lacks the music itself.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is what &lt;a href=&quot;http://area51.stackexchange.com/faq&quot;&gt;SE's Area 51 FAQ&lt;/a&gt; says about how we can solve our need more-users/more-expert-users/more-questions-per-day/more-expert-questions/more-in-depth-topics problems:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;h2&gt;What makes good questions?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The questions on your site say a lot about the community. To attract experts,&#xA;  you need a site where people are asking very interesting and challenging&#xA;  questions, not the basic questions found on every other Q&amp;amp;A site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Music experts love music, so they will probably stand by whatever place or site fulfilled with music, mainly in it's sound form and also, in those music traditions where it applies, in it's musical notation form. Both aren't frequently present in this site. There are musical notation images, many guitar tabs and graphs thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;http://jtab.tardate.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;jTab&lt;/a&gt; integration, and links to audio. But that doesn't meet the awesome possibilities that SE's well thought format can open to music. Both audio and musical notation should be easily transformed and kneaded, so that music is organically treated by the users in both questions and answers. One user should be able to typeset music easily, so that the music he writes can be instantly reproduced by the other users, and so that the answerer can easily take the question's music and change just one note from it and put the answer example back and playable by all the other users, an answer that can also be further transformed by other users. I imagine lots of stimulating and challenging on-topic questions that not only can't be effectively treated with the site's current format, but also could be treated here in a unique, new and exclusive way. The statement that summarizes my solution proposal is: &lt;strong&gt;we need to work in an integrated software solution that rises this site's possibilities to the top by providing the specialized tools it needs to integrate the music itself into Stack Exchange's awesome way of conceiving Q&amp;amp;A mechanics.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Don't get me wrong. I'm not asking how to put audio or music notation in my answers, as other people did. I'm exhorting you to think about how exclusive and awesome this site could be for any musician if this features are developed so that audio and notation can be interactively treated. It's not just about being able to integrate isolated music media in the site. The experts, teachers, rock stars, composers, conductors, clarinetists and kazoo players waiting out there to be amazed by our site will be too busy in their affairs to ask or answer stuff containing music itself (that music they love and live for) if they have got to typeset their music notation examples manually, make a screen shot, cut it, upload it and post it; or going to the piano to figure out how a question's music does actually sound, and typesetting manually the asker's example to introduce whatever little changes are needed and doing after the whole uploading process mentioned above. I've often seen questions about scales and chords that use regular letters like Eb-G-Bb, which isn't as versatile and comfortable as working with the conventional notation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The optimal way to input the music directly in the answer editor would be &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lilypond.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;LilyPond&lt;/a&gt;, as concluded in &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2/is-there-some-sort-of-mark-up-for-music-notation&quot;&gt;another question&lt;/a&gt;. The main reason is that &lt;strong&gt;it's code is so simple that you can actually sing the music as you write it, in real time&lt;/strong&gt;. It's also focused on generating &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lilypond.org/introduction.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;very well readable output&lt;/a&gt;, it generates midi files and it's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lilypond.org/manuals.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt; is a goldmine. It also supports &lt;a href=&quot;http://lilypond.org/doc/v2.17/Documentation/notation/common-notation-for-fretted-strings#default-tablatures&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;guitar and bass tabs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://lilypond.org/doc/v2.12/Documentation/user/lilypond/Accordion#Accordion&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;accordion diagrams&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://lilypond.org/doc/v2.17/Documentation/notation/woodwind-diagrams.it.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;wind instrument fingering graphs&lt;/a&gt;, and notation styles including even &lt;a href=&quot;http://lilypond.org/doc/v2.17/Documentation/notation/ancient-notation&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;gregorian chant&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://lilypond.org/doc/v2.17/Documentation/notation/typesetting-mensural-music&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;mensural notation&lt;/a&gt;, just to mention some of the possibilities it's got. So every single music freak will find resources to express himself with his habitual notation tools by just integrating this awesome piece of software. It's got many useful defaults that require minimal syntax knowing for any scales/chords-related stuff people might want to talk about. The needed syntax is so minimum like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.meta.stackexchange.com/editing-help&quot;&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt; commands we all use in the editor. Most of what the users would need can be summarized in two lines of code. &lt;code&gt;c d e f g a b&lt;/code&gt; for notes, adding &lt;code&gt;is&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;es&lt;/code&gt; to the notes for sharp and flat, &lt;code&gt;\relative c { notes-go-here }&lt;/code&gt; to print always the nearer octave note so you don't have to specify absolute octave note values every time, grouping notes in chords by putting them between &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt; &amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;s, and adding a &lt;code&gt;'&lt;/code&gt; or a &lt;code&gt;,&lt;/code&gt; to the notes to go an octave up or down respectively in the cases you need to modify the handy &lt;code&gt;\relative c&lt;/code&gt; behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here is an example with it's output:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;\relative c' { c cis d e f' e ges a b c, &amp;lt;g b d&amp;gt; &amp;lt;c, e g&amp;gt; }&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/6453v.png&quot; alt=&quot;LilyPond example&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As you see, pentagram, key, time signature, bar lines and rhythms are automatically generated by default, so with minimum input you get a full featured output. We could tune our software solution defaults to print whole notes as a default, as they are usually used in chord and scales examples. The rhythm is however easily modified with numbers attached to the notes, as they appear in time signatures (&lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; for whole note, &lt;code&gt;4&lt;/code&gt; for quarter note, etc...) Adding a &lt;em&gt;Music&lt;/em&gt; tab to our music.SE's editor explaining this few things would be enough. And we could adapt a useful default behavior to be invoked with a command inspired in the other Markdown commands we use, something like &lt;code&gt;!music[ c cis d e f' e ges a b c, &amp;lt;g b d&amp;gt; &amp;lt;c, e g&amp;gt; ]&lt;/code&gt; for the example above. It could be really KISS, quick typing and time saving. Being able to &lt;code&gt;right click on music example -&amp;gt; copy lilypond code to clipboard&lt;/code&gt; would be the key to make possible to deal with the music without limitations, as math.SE users can access the question examples' LaTeX code easily with MathJax and edit it in their answers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;em&gt;play&lt;/em&gt; button with a time slider should be created by default on the site, next to each written music example. It'd make sense to use an on-line midi player for the LilyPond &lt;code&gt;.mid&lt;/code&gt; generated files, so that SE's servers store lightweight midi files instead of heavy audio files. &lt;a href=&quot;http://timidity.sourceforge.net/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;TiMidity++&lt;/a&gt; is a lightweight FLOSS midi player we could integrate for this. And a priority should be to have tools to deal with the audio, with the ability to comment at a certain time point of the audio, as in &lt;a href=&quot;https://soundcloud.com/apparat/a-new-error?in=apparat/sets/moderat-moderat&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;SoundCloud&lt;/a&gt;, or by being able to type &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4GsSCfOeAk&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;YouTube-like&lt;/a&gt; &lt;code&gt;00:48&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;05:23&lt;/code&gt; links in whatever answer, so that you can hear that point of the music just by clicking the time mark. This last one method would make more sense, but we'd have to figure out a way to distinguish time links from possible multiple audio files in one single question, to allow comparisons, etc... Dealing with recorded audio is more resource-consuming. But just imagine a direct mic-to-SE button in the editor, as SoundCloud features, so that whatever you record goes directly uploaded and included in a player widget, with all the time linking capabilities. That would be just the most awesome thing ever.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All this may sound a little utopian and I'm conscious that it wouldn't be an easy task and that there are all kinds of technical issues to think about. But I know this is possible with today's technology. Just imagine how at-home will every musician feel in a site where you can discuss music even easily as face to face, given these proper tools and infrastructure to be able to really treat in-depth topics about music. The final result is exclusiveness, which is the reason people end often in other SE sites when they search for stuff related with their matters. For my computing issues I ended often by chance in a Stack Overflow or a Super User answer, because those questions and answers where so interesting and challenging that they generated exclusive content, only present in those sites. One of the worse things of today's music.SE is that a significant part of it's actual content is also written, explained and easily found in other sites and books.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, does this specific software solution make sense to you? Do you think it's possible? Unfortunately, my today's programming knowledge is limited, so I could collaborate with brainstorming or lilypond templates, but not with the software writing itself. Are there programmers who agree with the usefulness of this software and that would agree to commit in a developing team to make this real? Is there anybody with experience in developing or leading open source software projects? Both LilyPond and TiMidity++ are free and open source software, as other tools that could be helpful at dealing with sound, like &lt;a href=&quot;http://puredata.info/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Pure Data&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.csounds.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Csound&lt;/a&gt;. I'm sure that if we come up with something serious and consistent, it would be possible to include the software in the SE infrastructure, in the same way special software solutions were added to other sites, along with SE editor custom commands. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Really, excuse me for the exaggeratedly and massively long post. I promise I tried to be as brief as possible. I just really want to construct towards a Q&amp;amp;A music site as good as Stack Exchange and today's technology and musicians deserve. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Questionbibliography :O&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I told at the beginning, most of what I consider and talk about here rests in what I red in many other meta questions.

Perhaps, until it can be implemented directly in the site, it can be a &quot;recommended&quot; tool for typesetting music for use in questions on the site. Anyone who has gone through the trouble to learn Lilypond will probably also have it installed on their system. We're not a forum and don't have sticky threads and the like; I'm not sure what the StackExchange equivalent of an &quot;announcement thread&quot; would be. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the main issues would hold up the permanent implication of Lilypond on this site is that every time a change is made in the music, the entire file needs to be recompiled. Questions, while being written, have a preview pane below with real-time updating of files, and that would be tricky to get around.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, Lilypond is not just Lilypond, either. As I understand it, several other programming languages and compilers are involved with processing the Lilypond syntax. So the developers would really have to implement several different major programs, if you know what I mean by that. It would be a considerable project to undertake.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On top of that, Lilypond is updated on a frequent basis, and there are always &lt;em&gt;major&lt;/em&gt; changes made in each new version. With every new version of Lilypond, the implementation would have to be updated on a similar scale or even completely redone to fit the new version, because whenever a new version of Lilypond comes out, that's what the community of users will learn.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have a hard time seeing it happen, however awesome it would be.

I thought I would add my voice here - albeit a little late - to the discussion just to clarify why I did / do what I do.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Concerning Alex's post, I honestly wasn't even thinking about semantic spelling localizations - I merely thought the words were misspelled and was correcting for error.  I believe Tim referenced that some people act as &quot;teachers&quot; on the Music SE, and I can't help but feel as if that was directed towards me.  I am a teacher by profession, so I'm always looking for ways to help clarify information for others.  If I legitimately had questions that I thought would be best answered by the Music SE, I would post questions.  The majority of my quandaries are composition related and very specific and wouldn't be helpful for the site.  Also, like most people I suspect, I usually am able to answer my own questions with a little bit of research.  But I digress.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't edit grammar in posts to be &quot;grammar police&quot; or to try and put my stamp on everything.  This site serves the larger good of the internet, and I believe that if someone comes to the site looking for answers to their questions, they should be able to read the question / answers with correct grammar and presented in a clear, professional way.  It only hurts the Music SE's credibility and reliability for information if visitors have to wade through piles of internet slang and sentence fragments.  Further, by having clear communication of ideas (through correct grammar) it minimizes variables that can interfere with learning.  And really, when you boil SE down, it's not about the individual subjects, it's about learning.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As NReilingh mentioned in a comment, SE is collaborative, and just because I make an edit on something doesn't mean that my edit(s) are the end-all be-all. I encourage people to change or revert my edits or any other edits &lt;em&gt;as long as they are constructive and attempt to improve the answer or question.&lt;/em&gt; Edits I do are not out of hubris, but out of the desire to present a question or a solution in the &lt;strong&gt;best possible circumstance.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I whole-heartedly agree with &quot;respecting the original author,&quot; however, there is a difference between re-writing an entire question to suite one's own voice and changing simple conventions.  I have taken two surveys about Music SE's credibility (and I'm sure others have taken more,) but in reading the questions and answers, I can't help but say that though I agree that international and local language conventions should be respected, those who are posting answers / questions have a duty and responsibility to present their own information in the best way possible.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've understood this site to be an attempt at being a more professional exchange of information than a forum. But if high standards are not held, what then really differentiates this site from other resources?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, I may have over-stepped my bounds editing-wise, and if I'm posting too many answers and you all think I'm a conceited know-it-all, then I can't influence your perception of my intent no matter how earnest or honest I may be in my endeavor.  If I've over-stepped, then I sincerely apologize for doing so without realizing.  I won't apologize however, for attempting to make Music SE a better place.  We should all be holding one another accountable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Okay, I've said my piece.

On Writers we had a contest a couple months ago, tying into National Novel-Writing Month, to build quality content around genre tags.  This got us some great new questions and new users who've stuck around -- just what we needed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Contrariwise, contests that are &lt;em&gt;orthogonal&lt;/em&gt; to the site are not likely to get traction.  Would &quot;how to harmonize this melody&quot; questions be good questions here if there weren't a contest tie-in?  I don't think so; they're subjective, opinion-based, and not likely to be of broad, long-term interest (they don't help future readers).  So before pursing a contest, it's best to figure out what the site needs and build a proposal around &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, none of that stops any individual (or group of individuals) from offering to sponsor a contest, as one of the top users did on Board &amp;amp; Card Games about a year ago.  He offered his own prizes and set his own rules.  The contest benefitted the site (rewarded the things the site needed) so it got good participation.  (Possibly he could have asked for SE sponsorship for it, but he didn't.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So you are free to offer your &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; contest based on anything you like -- but even if it doesn't help the site, you do still want to make sure it won't harm the site.  A contest that calls for types of questions that will just get closed will only frustrate people.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't think this specific contest proposal aligns well with the site, but if you want to promote the site I encourage you to think about what the site needs and what kinds of contests could help with that.  And if you're willing to sponsor the contest yourself, that removes one hurdle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(In my experience prizes don't need to be major to motivate people.  On Mi Yodeya a couple years ago we had a contest for a ~$20 gift card; the point was the contest and the bragging rights, not the cash value of the prize.

Of course, we want the question to contain as many details as are needed to be able to provide a good answer.  In my ukulele question, if I hadn't specified which ukulele I had, no one would have known that it has a plastic bridge, which is unusual for ukuleles, nor would anyone have known that the manufacturer of that particular ukulele has a very generous warranty on their instruments.  In &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.meta.stackexchange.com/a/677/6851&quot;&gt;another answer on this question&lt;/a&gt;,  Alexander Troup indicated that he would vote to close a question about modifying a guitar if it included a particular make of guitar.  It seems unthinkable to me that we would close an otherwise good question because the asker gave too much detail about their particular situation.  A good question has lots of detail; a bad question has little or no detail.  I don't know much about the Ibanez Universe 777, but if there is something unique about that guitar that makes scalloping frets a different process than with other guitars, then it is an important detail, and should definitely be on topic.  Often, the asker doesn't know which details are important (because they don't know the answer), so we want to encourage as much detail as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With some instruments, make is less important.  For example, most trumpets are similar to each other, no matter who makes them.  (At least I think so, I actually don't know much about trumpets.)  With other instruments, especially electronic instruments, every make is different.  Sure, keyboard synthesizers all have keys laid out in a piano pattern, but all of the other buttons are different on every keyboard.  When asking a question about keyboards, the specific keyboard being played is crucial information.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At one time on Stack Exchange, questions could be closed for being too localized.  The idea was that we want questions and answers to be useful to more than just one person.  However, this is hard to judge.  How do you know that no one else will ever have the same question?  Sure, you might never buy a PSR i455 keyboard, but that doesn't mean that there aren't other people that do have them.  Stack Exchange has since &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2013/06/the-war-of-the-closes/&quot;&gt;gotten rid of &quot;Too Localized&quot;&lt;/a&gt; as a close reason network-wide.  There are other reasons to close, but the question we are talking about doesn't meet any of them: the question is not a duplicate of another one, it is not off topic, it is not unclear, it is not too broad, and it is not primarily opinion-based.

So a question about playing an instrument is definitely on-topic, and a question about lighting is not.  Even though lighting can be an important part of a performance, we only answer questions about making music here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Playing recorded music can be a gray area.

However, those questions are not about a DJ in the sense of a radio or wedding DJ, playing complete songs, but rather a DJ that mixes and combines recorded sounds in a new way to make new live music.  One is making music, the other is simply playing back previously recorded music.  We only allow the questions about making music.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For questions that deal with the other aspects of a musical performance, there are other sites:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sound.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;Sound Design&lt;/a&gt; for questions about live audio and recording equipment and techniques.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://video.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;Video Production&lt;/a&gt; for questions about video recording and video playback during a performance.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://superuser.com/&quot;&gt;Super User&lt;/a&gt; can help with general computer hardware and software questions for audio playback and other purposes not directly related to making music.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are some proposed sites in &lt;a href=&quot;http://area51.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;Area 51&lt;/a&gt; that will also be useful if and when they launch:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/53104/theatre?referrer=z_OiOxXD4_oyVElmt9PeEw2&quot;&gt;Theatre&lt;/a&gt; might cover technical aspects, theatre management, and perhaps even ticket sales and promotion.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/64009/entertainment-lighting?referrer=ujZCFTfJlnXA8jScE7Kc4Q2&quot;&gt;Entertainment Lighting&lt;/a&gt; specifically focuses on the lighting aspects of performance.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="6851" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:59:01.783" LastActivityDate="2014-03-03T02:57:57.130" CommentCount="0" />

Traktor is absolutely music software, but appears to be just as much iTunes as it is Ableton or Logic. If we decide that DJing is within scope, them library management in Tractor would be on-topic, as would some high-level questions about iTunes. Conversely, there are many artists that program with Max/MSP--a program that can be used for musical audio synthesis and processing, but can also control lights and visuals or anything else if you know a little Python.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I believe further discussion is warranted to come up with a 1-2 sentence criteria for question content related to software--not the easiest task, to be sure, but worthwhile to update the FAQ if we succeed and reach a consensus.

Here is the whole question below minus the picture:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&#xA;Title: What instrument is this woman playing with Ravi Shankar?&#xA;&#xA;I'm not sure if this is an appropriate forum for this question.&#xA;&#xA;This is a frame shot of Ravi Shankar playing on the Dick Cavett show in 1970.&#xA;&#xA;Does anyone know who is the woman on the right? What instrument is she playing? &#xA;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If someone was to search the site and try to identify that instrument, they most likely won't find it. Also the substance you are talking about in the related questions that happened in the answer. The answer and comments together are very good for what is given and provides a lot of information about the instrument in question.  The question doesn't even reference what the instrument looks like without the picture or it's purpose so rephrasing the title is useless.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Stepping back for a second I learned the instrument in question was a Tambura and produces a droning sound, but this question will be useless for anyone to search in a week almost because of the title and content.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Identifying an instrument is off-topic as per our scope, but I believe if the question has substance and is descriptive in the title and the actual question I think it would fit fine here. I'm pretty sure the real reason identifying and instrument is off-topic is so we don't get questions like &quot;What is this instrument? I found in my basement. Here is a picture.&quot; which is useful to no one but the asker. An easy one for example &quot;What is the four stringed instrument that is found in most pop and rock bands called?&quot; (Bass guitar). A very very simple example, but is much better than &quot;What is this? + picture&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The community has changed even in the short time I've been here and I feel every once in a while we should have a discussion about the scope and loosen it/tighten it as needed. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also feel like a good chuck of the community (mostly newcomers) does't know what the scope of the site is. Even though this isn't the best stat, there are 204 awarded Informed badges compared to the 1.7k awarded Autobiographer badges so while 1.7k people filled out all user profile fields only 204 read the entire about page. To me that say people don't check what's on-topic and off-topic. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The last point I want to bring up is even when a question is 100% off-topic it still takes about a day for it to be closed. For example, as of now the example question has been posed for 19 hours and there are 3 votes to close.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think in general we need to figure out what's on-topic and off-topic, enforce it a little better then we currently are, and reward good examples of questions and answers. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="7222" LastActivityDate="2014-04-08T19:01:51.097" CommentCount="0" />

In other words, the actual examples may aid the OP in gaining a better understanding of the common property that unites these compositions in their particular class.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Apart from these objections, there are more reasons why these questions should not have been closed IMO.

These examples are useful since they illustrate a particular aspect of musical composition, which can add enormously to understanding. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first question is also about finding a well-defined class of compositions, with the objective of finding pieces to perform. It seems completely absurd to state that finding pieces written by one of the most revered geniuses of western classical music for an enormously ubiquitous kind of ensemble is of little interest to other users, especially since this particular information is not that easy to obtain by googling.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Therefore I respectfully ask that the decision to close these questions is reverted, and that future questions of this kind are more closely scrutinized to do justice to the true nature of such questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Roland&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="8883" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:41:38.193" LastActivityDate="2014-04-29T11:32:17.810" Title="Please relax the policy on questions that ask for examples of a particular class of compositions" Tags="&lt;discussion&gt;" AnswerCount="3" CommentCount="28" FavoriteCount="1" />

These are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Questions at their core should be about a discrete &lt;em&gt;problem&lt;/em&gt; you are trying to solve&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;These problems should theoretically be applicable to another person at a different time with different circumstances.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The objective of these principals is to keep StackExchange more like a Q+A site than a forum, and that all user contributions (answers &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; questions) contribute to a perpetually useful knowledge base for the benefit of all.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Questions that need to be closed usually fit within one of two categories:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Questions that have musical problems, but are not being asked in a manner that addresses the issue at hand.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Questions that &lt;em&gt;look&lt;/em&gt; like musical problems, but once you get to the root of the issue at hand, they are actually about something different.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the second category, often it's impossible for someone to realize this without musical training, and as such, comments allow us to point the asker in the right direction as we send them on their way. For questions in the first category, the whole purpose of renaming &lt;code&gt;[closed]&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;[on hold]&lt;/code&gt; was to communicate that the question &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be a good one, but it needs to be revised or clarified by the asker before being reopened.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is also where most of the close reasons come into play, and why they tend to amount either to &quot;too broad&quot; or &quot;too localized&quot;. &lt;strong&gt;For example:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Let's say you are an inexperienced choir director and you need some help programming a spring concert. Some lousy questions you could ask in this situation might be &quot;What music should I program for a middle school choir concert?&quot; or &quot;What piece should I use to balance a choir program consisting of &lt;em&gt;piece x&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;piece y&lt;/em&gt;?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The first question would be closed as &quot;too broad&quot; since it is completely open-ended, even if it was &quot;well-defined&quot; as to include the choir's current ability level and each child's range. (Being well-defined does not mean the question is a good one.) The second question would be closed as &quot;too localized&quot;, since it would be useful only to you at this particular moment in time. The &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; question to ask might be something like &quot;What aspects of repertoire should I consider when programming a concert for a middle school choir?&quot; This question sits right in the sweet spot, on top of the problem at hand, and a really great answer will probably include some examples of repertoire you might be able to use, or some resources for you to peruse, while still being useful for other people who have the same problem in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In light of this and my first point about close reasons being simplistic, I'd very much agree that the &quot;song identification&quot; criteria can be applied too broadly and in a non-constructive way. The &quot;off-topic&quot; close reasons that we have access to can be edited by a moderator, but we only have a default reason and three custom ones to choose from, so we have to choose based on the highest-volume types of closes that arise. Of course, this is also open to discussion on Meta, and if our high-rep users decide that different reasons would be more appropriate, we will change accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As it exists now, the &quot;song identification&quot; close reason is meant to be used for questions where the asker provides a description or recording of some music and expects an answer of how to find it or music like it on record. These questions typically come from brand new users with little musical training, and they occur very frequently. Furthermore, the questions hold almost no value to future readers, and the only way to answer such a question is to guess properly. The community has been pretty clear that this is not what they want the site to be about, so the close reason exists as it does.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Aside: In researching this answer, I came to the realization that our reputation limit for the privilege of casting close votes is still set to that of a day 1 beta site, even after THREE YEARS in Beta. (Incidentally, happy belated birthday to Music.SE!) This has not scaled up with the general reputation of our user base, and so many more people have the ability to cast a close vote than would typically be the case were we out of beta (500 rep instead of 3,000). I think this is something that myself and the other mods should consider when reviewing questions closed by non-moderator vote.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Specific Examples&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://music.stackexchange.com/q/16312/133&quot;&gt;Which pieces did Mozart write originally for SATB choir a cappella?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'd say of your three examples, this one has the most merit: I think it is potentially useful to future readers, and the question itself was well-asked and well-answered. There are some valid points for closing; the root of the question really isn't about music so much as it is &quot;How do I find and navigate Mozart's catalogue?&quot; But, I would agree that the &quot;song identification&quot; criteria was incorrectly applied here. Personally, and in light of the low-rep votes that caused the question close, I would like to see this question edited to remove the limitation of excluding arrangements, nominated for reopening and made community wiki--more on that later.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://music.stackexchange.com/q/15586/133&quot;&gt;Retrograde and Inverted songs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this case, while the subject matter is more interesting than the typical song identification question, it is pretty clear to me that the asker heard a single example that he became fascinated with, and is now coming to us to try to find more music like it (the asker asked the same question in the comments of the YouTube video he linked). In other words, a textbook example of a song identification question. The reasons I detailed above apply to this, and I agree with the close. There are certainly lots of good questions that could be asked about retrograde or inverted melodies, and those answers could conceivably (I hope) include examples, but this question is pretty clearly off-topic according to the site's criteria.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://music.stackexchange.com/q/16810/133&quot;&gt;How to identify a pop tune that has vocal harmonization that does not move in parallel motion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This question, to me, is very confusing. The close reason probably should have been &quot;Unclear what you're asking&quot;, since it is unclear what problem the asker is attempting to solve with the question--instead, it just seems like academic trivia. There's nothing wrong with academic trivia, of course, but that is more suited to a forum (or chat) than it is a StackExchange Q+A site. Again, there are certainly interesting questions that can be asked about vocal harmonization in popular music!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;I want to also give a reminder here that close votes and edits go both ways -- none of the questions that were linked got any &quot;reopen&quot; votes, nor were any of them edited after the close to improve them. Any user able to cast a close vote (reputation &gt;500, at present) should be able to cast a reopen vote. (I don't believe there are any systematic things I'm missing that prevent this, but correct me if I'm wrong.) It's far more common that closed questions simply need to be improved than it is that the site's definition needs to be modified.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Repertoire Lists&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This has been on my mind for some time as an aspect of the site's scope that I think we &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; modify. Generally, questions looking for repertoire recommendations tend to be closed as &quot;too localized&quot; or &quot;opinion-based&quot;, but I think a case can be made for accepting certain questions like this in our subject area. Not every site needs to be run exactly like StackOverflow (certainly, many other sites have deviated significantly), and I think we should try to take into account the nature of classical music when thinking about these questions. What I mean by this is that repertoire moves VERY slowly in the classical and academic worlds, and questions about &lt;em&gt;what that repertoire is&lt;/em&gt; are both long-lasting and objectively answerable. If I speak to any other classically-trained trombone player in the world, the words &quot;Grøndahl&quot; or &quot;David&quot; (provided you pronounce them properly) mean exactly the same thing -- a trombone concerto that everyone has either played or heard in studio class dozens of times. To this end, I would love to see us adapt the Community Wiki feature. This would allow us to keep useful lists of important repertoire itemized by popularity, but prevent undesired gains in reputation resulting from the simple contribution of the name of a piece.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Conclusion/Short Version&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I hope this sheds some light on what we are trying to make Music.StackExchange into, and why. Examples and responses to various questions are included above, but it is important for us mods to keep an eye out for questions that are closed by low-rep close votes. At the same time, users should be proactive in figuring out how to edit, improve, and reopen questions so that meta discussions can be more specific and efficient instead of long-winded and overarching. Finally, I would like to see Music.SE embrace Community Wiki for repertoire list questions that are well-asked, objectively answerable, and perpetually relevant.

This is often known as &quot;shopping list&quot; or &quot;popularity list&quot; that tend to be overly popular and not very useful to the intent of StackOverflow. This proved to be a real problem at StackOverflow as these questions became very visible on the site because they were very popular, but they hide the most useful questions for developers trying to find good technical solutions to specific programming issues. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The problem was tried to be solved by converting these types to &quot;Community Wiki&quot; that would release the question to be editable by more users, and removing reputation on votes for it. It turned out to not solve the problem, so it ended up with all those type of questions were banned as off topic, which I think is a good thing - both for StackOverflow, and most other StackExchange sites. This strict moderation has been one of many factors to make StackOverflow the number one reference to quickly find good answers to a programming problem you might have.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Musical Practice &amp;amp; Performance&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is in the nature of music that we should not execute the same harsh rules here as on a programming site. This is something that we all need to think about before we hit the close button on a question. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In many cases the questions can be improved to be a better fit without changing the goal of what the OP wish to get answered. My opinion is that these type of questions would benefit from having a base that asks for help on &lt;strong&gt;how to recognize&lt;/strong&gt; the type of music in question, and end with a request to also back up with examples. This way, the answers are less in risk of being a dumb list of references. The result of adding more depth to the question is that the answers have more context so that people that does not know too much about the type of music that the OP has interest in, will also get more insight by just reading the question/answers without having to do an in depth study themselves to just get a basic understanding on what the question is all about.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the examples you refer to, I agree that the reason behind those questions might very well be on topic here. They just need a slight editing to not become in risk of resulting in something that looks like an advanced Google search result. I have already slightly edited the two last.

Actually, the answers that have already been provided are very good, and have good theoretical explanations that are helpful to everyone, and examples to go with that (so the OP gets what he wants at the same time as the content is useful in a more generic aspect).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="249" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:41:38.193" LastActivityDate="2014-04-29T11:32:17.810" CommentCount="8" />

For example: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Do you feel that learning to play the tuba using video chat can be&#xA;  effective?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Edit: Ok, now I've seen the original that spawned this meta-question.  Yes, you do talk about music.  You also come across as a particularly unpopular schoolteacher, first pontificating on your own ideas, then didactically telling everyone what rules we must follow if we are to be permitted to involve ourselves in answering your question.  Your sarcastic comments to the moderators are based on the idea that the only reason that they are blocking your question is that they are too obtuse to understand it without your &quot;clarifications&quot;.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, I revise my answer thus: start with an attitude adjustment.  Once you have adjusted your attitude sufficiently to not care whether or not anyone who is giving advice and suggestions is &quot;really&quot; attacking you, try looking at the suggestions given.  Then, try asking the question over again.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="9399" LastEditorUserId="9399" LastEditDate="2014-04-30T22:01:45.087" LastActivityDate="2014-04-30T22:01:45.087" CommentCount="3" />

  <row Id="777" PostTypeId="1" CreationDate="2014-05-16T20:01:01.193" Score="17" ViewCount="243" Body="&lt;p&gt;One of the topic areas of Music.SE that is most exciting and interesting to me is musicology.  Because SE, as a system, is richly populated with -- and I use this term with all pride and fondness -- geeks, Music.SE is disproportionately blessed with early musicians and other people with passion for music history.  Music.SE's denizens are unusually capable of supporting questions into musicology, as a number of recent questions have demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, insofar as it is SE's mission to be a repository of good answers to interesting and sometimes recondite questions practitioners of a technical discipline might ask, and to expose those answers to Google so that anyone in the world asking those questions finds those answers, Music.SE supporting musicology questions is not only right in line with what SE is trying to achieve, it is an example of how excellently SE can support sophisticated, deep, knowledgable questions and answers in tiny, under-appreciated academic fields.  Answers to musicology questions typically involve pointers to resources -- books, recordings, shows, scores -- that are otherwise hard for questioners to identify as relevant, and in doing so, help bring those musicological resources to wider audiences.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It seems obvious to &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt; that musicology is good for Music.SE, and Music.SE is good for musicology.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But we have a problem.  &lt;strong&gt;Musicology questions are tending to get put on hold and suspended.&lt;/strong&gt;  I don't think anybody is doing this because they hate musicology, or think musicology questions are, per se, off topic.  (Let me know if I'm mistaken about this!) The reasons cited are occasionally &quot;too broad&quot;, but more usually &quot;too opinion-based&quot;.  I think it's because the people voting to close don't realize that that has to do with the nature of musicology itself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;History, as a academic practice and discipline, is, fundamentally, about opinions.  Not opinions in the sense of &lt;em&gt;taste preferences&lt;/em&gt;, but in the sense of &lt;em&gt;considered hypotheses with substantiating evidence&lt;/em&gt;.  This is what historians &lt;strong&gt;do&lt;/strong&gt;: attempt to put together the jigsaw puzzle of the past, without the box, missing a lot of the pieces, and with multiple puzzle's pieces all jumbled together.  Historians construct hypotheses about how things were, or why, and they marshal the evidence they have, and set them loose in the world.  This is what makes history a fundamentally contentious field: conflicting hypotheses contend.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;History is a field where you almost never get to know that one answer is conclusively right.  The best you are ever likely get is that that the preponderance of evidence supports your contention.  But maybe tomorrow somebody will find a score, a recording, an instrument, a picture, a textual description which upends everything you thought.  We don't have time machines to go back and check.  Is this interpretation how it would have sounded in 1189AD?  Maybe, maybe not.  You do your homework, and you put it out there, and at best, fellow knowledgable people nod and say, &quot;that's a very compelling case.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Consequently, questions in the history of music don't necessarily have one right answer.  You can have five different, even contradictory answers, that all are valid, interesting, and informative.  That's not actually different from another sort of question that doesn't get any moderation push-back here: requests for suggestions of approaches to solve performance and mastery problems.  When someone posts, e.g. for suggestions how to address the challenge of dyslexia while learning to read music, there can be a nigh-infinite number of different suggestions, all of which are useful to know about.  Having &quot;the answer&quot; to a question be a collection of different answers isn't a bug, it's a feature.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Likewise, that there will be multiple, possibly contentious, responses to a musicology question is not a bug, it's a feature.  Musicology is like perl: TMTOWTDI.  Having one place where all the arguments are represented: that's not a problem, that's an achievement.  Having a place where the puzzle pieces -- the bits of evidence -- are collected?  That's fabulous.  Having a place where the puzzle pieces are discussed, and where are collected the arguments whether or not they are part of the puzzle being assembled?  Also fabulous.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The thing that gets me is that the SE platform, with its scoring mechanisms, is a particularly great at supporting that kind of discourse.  People who find an argument particularly compelling can upvote it.  People who disagree with an argument can object in comments, and the comments themselves can be endorsed by those who agree.  People who have additional substantiating evidence can edit it right in to an answer.  No one argument has to &quot;win&quot;, all, at their varying levels of community support, show up on the page -- and if there's additional future evidence that changes things, well, votes can be added or changed.  SE actually handles &quot;opinions&quot; really, really well.  And by &quot;well&quot; I mean &quot;in a way which is informative to answer seekers and other researchers&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But for Music.SE to be a home for musicology, it's got to stop unwittingly suppressing musicological questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From one perspective, that means relaxing the &quot;not opinion-based&quot; standard.  I see it from another perspective: realizing that questions about associations, influences, labels, and tastes are no more &quot;opinion&quot; based and are just as substantiatable as questions like &quot;how do I fix this technique problem?&quot;  and that the solution, if there is a problem, shouldn't be to ban or &quot;fix&quot; the &lt;strong&gt;question&lt;/strong&gt;, but to hold &lt;strong&gt;answers&lt;/strong&gt; to a high standard. &lt;em&gt;Same as with any questions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Regardless of how you get there, it means seeing a question like &quot;Are the works or artists that are considered particularly influential in the development this style, and if so what/who?&quot; and not dropping the banhammer on them as &quot;likely to have opinion based answers&quot;, but rather reminding &lt;strong&gt;answerers&lt;/strong&gt;, &quot;Bring evidence&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let me put this another way: I want, not unreasonably I think, Music.SE to be the place where somebody asking &quot;Should I use Beethoven's metronome markings?&quot; (for those that don't know: a famous, important, unresolved contentious issue of musicology that directly intersects musical practice) winds up, and finds a thorough discussion of the evidence for and against.  Right now, when I put &quot;beethoven metronome markings&quot; into Google, you know what discussion site it sends me to?  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/1vp59t/ludvig_van_beethoven_actually_intended_for_his/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Reddit.&lt;/a&gt;  (While there are fabulous, thoughtful technical discussions on Reddit (truly!) that... is not one.)  But right now, if somebody puts &quot;Should I...&quot; &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; it will be shot down as &quot;too opinion-based&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Could we not do this anymore?  Because I respectfully submit it's killing off one of the best, most important, most &lt;em&gt;useful&lt;/em&gt; parts of Music.SE.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A few examples:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I personally rescued &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.stackexchange.com/questions/17301/how-did-the-saxophone-come-to-be-considered-romantic/&quot;&gt;&quot;Why is the saxophone considered romantic?&quot;&lt;/a&gt; and have made a stab at saving &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.stackexchange.com/questions/17528/which-disco-tracks-were-the-most-influential-in-electronic-music&quot;&gt;&quot;Which disco tracks were the most influential in electronic music?&quot;&lt;/a&gt; which is still on hold as of this writing.

This acknowledgement could be accompanied with a statement of what we are trying to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I see two categories of things we are trying to avoid (beyond obviously non-musical or obviously subjective questions like &quot;who is the best/most-influential X?&quot;):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Questions whose answers are necessarily tied into the particular needs of an individual musician -- Most product and repertoire questions fall into this category. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Transcription questions -- this includes literal &quot;what are the notes/chords to X?&quot; questions, and &quot;what effect/instrument is X using in Y ...&quot; and &#xA;even &quot;what song is played in X?&quot;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Maybe spelling out these (and other?) goals, and how they inform the list of off-topic questions is worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm also have the sense that the strictness of this site tends to go in waves -- things get pretty loose, then high-rep users start to buckle-down and so on.&#xA;I suspect that the recent series of discussions on meta (TODO: link to relevant questions) indicate that we'll be moving into one of these looser phases.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="2639" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:41:38.863" LastActivityDate="2014-05-21T14:53:27.993" CommentCount="0" />

Analysis of big songs, by big authors. (I know, what is &quot;big&quot;, right?

We can vote and discuss the specifics of the question (which work, which author, etc).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allow analysis requests from only selected authors and/or eras and/or any other filter. Maybe allow common practice works only, or maybe only from specific authors, or whatever you can think of. Again, we can set and discuss the specifics here, in the meta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allow analysis requests only from users above X reputation (I know this is out of pattern with other SE sites, but it might not be a bad idea to implement it on this scenario).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This type of question will likely end up being on topic in the Music Fan SE Proposal, which is close to reach the commitment stage.

In fact, in the case of well known authors and works, that analysis can be interesting, useful, and contain a high academic value, while being important to musical practice and performance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The idea is to allow analysis requests of specific music as long as it adheres to a specific criteria.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can find more about that suggestion here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.meta.stackexchange.com/q/848/7218&quot;&gt;I think we should start allowing the analysis of specific musical works&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To re-define the scope, we need to set that criteria.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which kind of analysis should be allowed?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With the idea of usefulness in mind, I think and propose that the analysis should be harmonic at the very least and cover the work completely (not only selected parts).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Why &quot;harmonic at the very least&quot;?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's the most common kind of analysis, so it will be useful to many people (assuming a well known work), and it's relevant to musical practice and performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prevents questions with very reduced scope and usefulness and/or interest (even within the work), like &quot;what's the time signature of this song?&quot;, or &quot;what's the chord progression of this part of the song?&quot;, or &quot;which are the chords of this song?&quot;. We could still allow these questions as long as they are part of a more complete analysis request (harmonic at the very least), but not if they are asked individually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Analysis of which works should be allowed?&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm of the idea of allowing analysis requests for any song. The community can express relevance, importance, and interest into the question via the voting system. We also leave the door open in case someone feels like answering a low interest question. Who knows? Maybe the analysis of that song in particular will be useful to someone else, even if it's not a big well known work at the moment of the question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another option is to allow analysis requests only about selected authors, works, eras, etc. We can use a combination of filters to make it as concise and complete as possible. I think common practice era is a must, but we can add authors and works from other periods and styles that are commonly analyzed or have the potential to be. Something like common practice era + Radiohead, Pink Floyd, ... (rock) + Coltrane, ... (Jazz) + etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This list of filters can be built somewhat objectively, based on popularity or relevance in the time and/or genre. It can be dynamic, it can accept requests. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The reason I'm proposing accepting all analysis requests without exceptions is that I think that filter list would be already implemented and expressed via the voting system. But who knows, maybe there's a good reason to still have a list of allowed analysis requests.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;In short.&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If we want to allow questions about the analysis of specific works we need to carve the scope. We need to discuss about:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which kind of analysis should be allowed?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysis of which works should be allowed?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;All of them?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Some of them?

There is a good argument for suggesting that a historical question like this is better suited to the proposed Music Fans site. But musical analysis and musicology are not restricted to the score (or recording); they don't take place in a vacuum. It is perfectly valid, and in many respects &lt;em&gt;desirable&lt;/em&gt;, for analysis of a piece of music to be informed (and enhanced!) by a historical and/or sociological perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, it is true that music from different eras and traditions does lend itself more readily to different analytical and musicological approaches. &quot;Classical&quot; music (or &quot;composed&quot; or &quot;art&quot; music) is readily analysed by means of the written score; popular and folk musics often make greater use of related &quot;extra-musical&quot; information when analysed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But I would point out that any kind of music is open to different analytical approaches: popular music can be analysed using the &quot;notes-on-the-page&quot; (even if this is the result of transcription); &quot;classical&quot; music can be analysed taking into account a historical/sociological perspective. Crucially, I would say that whatever the analytical or musicological approach, all eras and traditions of music are equally valid, and should be treated as such on this site. All existing music is part of music history.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This does, though, require the Music.SE community to judge as a whole which questions and answers genuinely explore an interesting aspect of a piece of music.

I don't have a lot of experience of other SE sites, so I don't know how easy it is to get changes made on them. The little experience I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; have of Meta-SO and Meta-SE, suggest that there is more action on these meta sites though. It seems as though suggestions become discussions and then changes, much more readily.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I see it, there are two main ways we could get some positive change for Music.SE using this meta site:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;create some &quot;direct&quot; posts, suggesting a couple of really useful changes, and then really try to gain support for them. In other words, try to rally around a &quot;DO WE WANT THIS CHANGING?&quot; type post. This way we can focus our efforts on making regular significant changes, &lt;em&gt;if necessary&lt;/em&gt;. Users of Music.SE have encouraged support for the new MusicFans.SE in a pretty proactive way (on this meta site and in chat), so a similar level of action would be possible for our own site. The mark-up language suggestion seems like a good first change to get behind.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;a more convoluted, but democratic, way to focus upon which changes may be considered important by the Music.SE community, would be to create a community-wiki question, listing a number of changes suggested regularly and/or recently. Answers could argue for or against different ideas, but also act as a place for users to vote upon what changes they think are &lt;em&gt;important&lt;/em&gt;. In theory, it would create a focal point for assessing what users feel &quot;needs-to-be-done&quot;. On the upside, everything is one place and it would be easy to assess support; on the downside, somebody would need to put a bit of time into assessing what subjects have come up recently/regularly on this meta site.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Or, an even simpler focal-point-question. &quot;What development do you think would most improve Music.SE?&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; Answers are given, arguing for useful changes, comments are made, voting shows what the community thinks is most important to them.

The implications of such a transition are also worrisome.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Personally, I have very little interest in ABC notation when compared with Lilypond. Lilypond effectively has feature parity with professional engraving programs like Sibelius and Finale, and in many cases outputs notation that is prettier than &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of them. I can't speak to the syntax differences and difficulties within the overlapping features, but I &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; say that the more complete capabilities of Lilypond are a big incentive &lt;em&gt;to me&lt;/em&gt; to learn it fully, should it be the one we decide to implement.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="133" LastActivityDate="2014-10-23T03:42:43.310" CommentCount="2" />

From what I understand, SE's features are usually based on the some kind of consensus that the features work best this way. The fact that it's easier to become a moderator in Beta is probably because the website is still young, and many people are not yet familiar with the rules for what's on topic and what isn't. Hence, more moderators are needed. Once you've shown that you &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; familiar with the rules, you're fit to be a moderator in Beta, so that you can help others in becoming more familiar with the rules as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once the site goes live, there needs to be a higher reputation requirement, because it's more important for all moderators to always make the right decisions.

On a live website, we should aim to have a moderator team that knows exactly what to do, and makes very few mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer: all of this is just my own speculation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even if &lt;em&gt;these&lt;/em&gt; are not the reasons, I am sure there are other ones.

I recall something about the conservative tonal composer Robert Simpson saying that he had learned more about large-scale tonal form from Arnold Schoenberg's (12-tone!) Piano Concerto than any contemporary symphony (and he &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; didn't like Schoenberg's music).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm answering this, though, primarily to bump the question up for further consideration because I think the whole question of analysis is a bit more important for illuminating musical praxis than the policies here assume. I joined here fairly recently, and was a little shocked to see that, when I ran across questions regarding analysis, they were being closed because &quot;only of interest to the questioner&quot;... on a site that is billed as &quot;Music: Practice and Theory&quot;. I'm not sure you can have theory without analysis, and you definitely can't have analysis without analysis of specific works. In this regard, music theory is rather similar to the sciences - you need to deal with the particular in order to make a stab at generalising. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The danger of &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; allowing analysis is that theory can then (and does) tend to devolve into prescriptive &quot;rules&quot;, and that is not really what theory is about.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also germane to the question here is that we need to put aside objectivity as a criterion in favour of &lt;em&gt;reasoned argument&lt;/em&gt;. Other than the sounds themselves and (when the music is notated) the notes on the paper, and (occasionally) facts of acoustics, psychoacoustics and sociology (and these latter rarely form a complete explanation for topics in music), there isn't that much that is objective about music (or any other art, for that matter). Reasoned argument based directly on elements of the music is entirely possible, however, and can and should be enforced by the mods. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerDisplayName="user16935" LastActivityDate="2014-12-26T21:09:45.510" CommentCount="1" />

Some do, some don't. Musicians probably have a better feel than most for what makes up a good progression, though, and can see its intricacies. What's bad, though, is that all musicians seem to think that they know the theory, because it's only slight exaggeration to say that standing in front of every deeper explanation is a simple but not very revealing answer. (For instance, 'stacked thirds' is an explanation for harmonics 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8; and one even sees such things in the work of otherwise accomplished composers, such as problematic transformations between pitch and rhythm, or crude-but-useful geometric representations of harmony.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have only been on this SE for a couple of days, but I seem to see the same divide happen here, and I'm afraid that the democratic approach seems to fail too often. Take here where I clearly cite a description of the progression mentioned as typical. There is no comment explaining what is wrong with this answer, and it falls to the bottom, below a reply that calls the progression a 'fantasia', and an upvoted comment 'Everything can't be explained by theory, since most music isn't written with an explicit reference to theory'. (Sincerely no offense is meant here, and I am not claiming my answer is necessarily correct; I am just taking these examples as a sort of microcosm.)&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;https://music.stackexchange.com/questions/25484/how-is-a-chord-progression-with-g-dm-f-and-g-possible&quot;&gt;How is a chord progression with G#, D#m, F and G possible?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't think this happens so often on other SE sites, that answers are given that just say theory is not applicable and upvotes ensue. I realize something similar happened in the study of language grammar after the dethroning of Latin-based analysis. Still, though, I don't think you'll find many serious practitioners of logic or language who would say there are no good explanations. Instead, the field has been enriched with higher-level concepts, deeper analyses, corrections, etc., to account for as much as possible. Understanding what is understandable takes nothing away from real poetics. Similar improvements have taken place in music theory. In another parallel to grammar splitting between the philosophical, the computer-based, the speech-act, etc., musical analysis has divided into many different sorts. The serialists have their atonal number sets. The popular harmonic analysis is intended for performers. (They need to be able to read on-the-fly, and so I feel it is not best-suited to a forum like SE. Still, it is the most popular, and I don't intend to change that.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I know that many of the top-rated contributors on this site understand musical theory and the history of theory well, as I have seen. Therefore, are there general guidelines you could give a newcomer with a somewhat-rigorous, somewhat-half-baked understanding of music, who wants to fit in here, and wants to give and get the best response?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;[ADDITION BASED ON COMMENTS AND FURTHER THOUGHTS]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ignoring voting, I think the realizations that I'm groping for are these:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(1) Prematurely answering that theory does not help to provide an explanation is likely to keep an explanation from being found or provided, at least in the timely manner required by SE. Theories and practices have been developed over thousands of years all over the world. Evidencing how the disconnect seems to occur with common theories and practices may help lead to a better explanation, however, and is to be encouraged; it may save someone effort or confusion, and also may be falsified.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(2) I suppose it is the burden of the answerer to support in detail why their explanation is to be considered 'better' than the possible alternatives, in the order that the answers are provided.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="17048" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:41:40.433" LastActivityDate="2014-12-31T19:24:41.873" Title="Do good answers get ignored?"

I don't think it should be a must, but I do agree that it enriches the question, it provides many benefits,  and it should be encouraged (but not required or enforced). Even SE admins seem to have different opinions on this, and I've been linked to both sides of the coin through admin's meta posts, blogs, podcasts, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, I stumbled upon this question:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://music.stackexchange.com/q/29550/7218&quot;&gt;How to set up multiple tracks recording in Magix music maker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The original closer (the first to vote close), which has now deleted all his comments, commented that he was closing because of &quot;lack of previous research&quot;. He also said that the answer &quot;could be found in the second link of a google search&quot; (which then became obvious that was not true), and that the definitive answer to that question was &quot;Music maker record one track at a time.(if I am not wrong)&quot;, that was what the second link said. He then deleted the comments because &quot;he already did more effort than the asker&quot; (he deleted that comment too some time after). You can also find my replies to those claims in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After doing some research myself, including the manual, and knowing a thing or two about DAWs (I make a living out of them), I found no definitive answer to his question. I did found that one person saying &quot;I think you can't&quot;, the same the original closer was referencing, but that's it. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think you can't&quot; is not a definitive answer, and it's the only one that can be found through previous research. There are many obscure software out there, a lot of which is poorly documented. That shouldn't be a reason to prohibit questions focusing on that software. I think it's the contrary, a very good reason to come here and ask those questions, making the potential answer available to other people. Isn't it the very goal and definition of SE?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Knowing this, is too far-fetched to think that the asker in fact did previous research but found no good answers to his question?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, why are we closing that question? (and potentially will close more on similar scenarios, which is why I'm trying to bring attention to this). We already stablished that in this case previous research is fruitless, so &lt;strong&gt;what else are we expecting from that question?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A second issue I find here is that the closers choose &quot;off topic&quot; as the reason. There is no close reason for lack of research, and I wasn't aware it was one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, in short, I have these questions/observations:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why are we closing questions because of lack research, when there is no definitive answer to find from that research, when the research is fruitless?&lt;/strong&gt; Not finding answers elsewhere shouldn't prohibit us from asking questions here.

But closing it? Is it justified? Is that what we want to do now?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If we are closing questions because of lack of previous research, why are we doing it just to a few select ones&lt;/strong&gt;? Most of the questions asked here do not share previous research. In fact a very small fraction of them do. Yet this is brought as a complain and /or close reason in a few selected cases. In this specific case it comes from people that don't know or understand the subject (you can see who voted to close in the vote history). This is fine, not knowing is fine, but it is also a good reason to avoid including lack of research as an enforced dynamic, as a close reason. &lt;strong&gt;Often the closers will have no way to correctly judge the research and results available, which I think was the case here.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If we make &quot;lack of research&quot; an official close reason, we should include it as an official reason in the close section, something you can select when voting to close a question.

They could be badly explained, badly formulated, distorted, biased, focused on a different expertise level (too complicated, too simplified), or just plain wrong.

Which I think is what happened in the linked example. The closer thought the answer could be easily found &quot;in the second link of a google search&quot;, but that was far from being the case. We would drown in false positives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;99% of the questions here do not include previous research. If we wanted to enforce previous research objectively, we would end up closing 99% of past and future questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inside that majority, we have countless gems of questions, answers, and discussions. To me it is clear that including previous research is not needed for having an excellent exchange, for having great questions, answers, and discussions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;That specific previous research would be relevant to that specific asker only. The previous research information can be useless for other users. For them, including previous research can be detrimental, can over-complicate an otherwise simple and/or elegant question. They want to know the answer to the question, not what the asker has researched about it, or if he/she did previous research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Potentially lazy questions can already be punished through lack of answers, downvotes, and comments by the users that think it was lazy.

I've run across a few that come close to this latter state of affairs; they were, shall we say, less than convincing.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You cannot really teach analysis without something specific to analyse. Analytic techniques that purport to work with everything don't - one size does not fit all, primarily because most analytic techniques are reductive in nature, and thus cannot cover everything of interest. (I'm reminded of the story of Schoenberg looking over Schenker's analysis of, I believe, one of Schubert's symphonies, and saying, &quot;Where are my favourite passages? Oh, there they are, in all those little notes!&quot;)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The corollary to 1 &amp;amp; 2 is that a lot of questions will require specific examples, and it is in many ways a moot point whether they are provided with the question or by one of the answers (or both).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note also that the question I referenced above never really changed before it was reopened; a little &quot;syntactic sugar&quot; was added to make it acceptable, and that shouldn't have been necessary in the first place. The OP asked a fairly precise question, and was genuinely interested in how the technique works. When how something works becomes a focus, you will generally get answers of general interest. It may be wise in cases like this, however, to add a tag or two to make the question and answers properly searchable when similar questions come up.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm generally in favour of keeping the range of questions open, because it is impossible to know when something in one kind of music may provide pointers for a very different style or genre. For example, I'm learning more about jazz and pop theory here than I have from friends in those fields - not all practitioners are good at describing what they do. This is useful to me, because my classical compositions frequently have a faint whiff of prog and jazz in the background (the stuff I grew up with, eh?).  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Broken windows should not be a problem. We do not need to abandon &quot;of interest only to the person asking the question.&quot;&lt;/em&gt; We just need to cut the tie between that reason for closing and the analysis of specific works. The questions that we worry about cluttering the site, questions such as &quot;What chord is he playing here?&quot; or &quot;What's the time signature here?&quot;, &lt;strong&gt;aren't&lt;/strong&gt; analysis, not when a cursory read of any associated sheet music can give the answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerDisplayName="user16935" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:41:40.433" LastActivityDate="2015-02-09T20:07:29.493" CommentCount="4" />

But one thing that comes to mind is if there was a way the moderators could reach out to some of the members who seem to have a history of high quality questions, answers and/or comments, and ask them to help in specific ways with the process of improving the overall quality of the content on the site.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Recognizing that would be asking a great deal from the moderators to take on that task by themselves, I might suggest that the &lt;strong&gt;moderators could appoint a panel of special deputy moderators in charge of quality control&lt;/strong&gt;, who would be willing to participate and be empowered with the ability to reach out to individual members in some type of message system (or private chat) similar to what I imagine moderators can do now. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I feel we need to give these members an important sounding title to enhance their credibility.  In other words, I know if a moderator reaches out to me and ask for help on an issue, I will have a higher probability of commitment due to the respect I have for them simply based on their title as a &quot;Moderator&quot;.  It's like &quot;President&quot;, &quot;Director&quot;, &quot;Enforcement Officer&quot;, etc. Certain titles just command respect.   &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My suggestion falls short of giving these &quot;special deputies&quot; (or whatever title we choose to bestow) any other power, other than as it relates to direct communication with individual members.  I would suggest that any members of such a QC panel, agree to participate in regular meetings in a special chat room where they could discuss the goals of the panel and ways they can use their position to help improve the site.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first few meetings would be to define the mission statement and code of conduct and other guidelines that all could agree on.  If you would like me to help organize such a panel, I would be willing to help.   &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't mean to suggest that such a panel would be solely responsible for the efforts to improve the content.  Rather the panel would be tasked to recruit more members of the community to help with the process of improving the site by reaching out to them and asking them to help.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="16897" LastEditorUserId="16897" LastEditDate="2015-02-19T05:02:50.093" LastActivityDate="2015-02-19T05:02:50.093" CommentCount="0" />

Can I get more specific reasoning for this?  It's entirely possible that this question doesn't belong on this site, but this reasoning does not seem valid to me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This question is very different from questions like 'Transcribe this song for me' or 'Tell me what song this is' - I understand how those types of questions would only benefit another user if they were looking for the same exact song.  Instead, this is a fairly common question among new (especially younger) dancers who struggle to hear the difference between the categories, and don't have the musicality that's required.  To many, it seems like people are arbitrarily saying 'this song is okay' and 'this song is not okay' and they don't have the sample size to identify a trend.  This is actually a self learning or resource request (pretty common on SE sites) and is more a question of 'How do I identify/recognize these strictly defined but undocumented* categories of music?' - only a beginner does not know they are undocumented and probably doesn't understand they are strictly defined.  A beginner will not know to type any of those keywords into Google, they are much more likely to type words similar to what the OP did.  That's one of the best things about SE sites in my opinion - they often bridge the gap between cluelessness and being able to learn much more on your own.  I have frequently mined new keywords from them and used the keywords to open the door to knowledge I previously was not connected to.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To be clear, I'm not opposed to more specific/better wording as an edit/addition to the OP's question.  But I think that removing the current wording will result in many Google searches missing the connection - that they could have had - to this path of learning.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;*I really mean not well documented, and certainly not online/in commonplace books as would be the case for the typical Stack Overflow or Cross Validated question.

Different people need and look for different things in instruments so that recommendation would most likely only be valid for the one person and extremly option based. A question asking what to look for would be perfectly in our scope and more useful to everyone. That way someone can look at models and know what to look for and make an educated decision when buying the instrument. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The quote you keep linking is incomplete as I pointed out in the comments.

Here's the whole question:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Chopin Etude Op. 9 No. 2 In the 13th full bar, Right hand 5th note. My&#xA;  music sheet shows a Cb. &lt;strong&gt;What, I puzzle, is a C-flat?&lt;/strong&gt; Should it be&#xA;  there? Should it be played as B natural followed by B-flat?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The bolded part is the core question. We talk about this concept which is called enharmonic equivalence a lot on this site and this is one example of it. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The B# question asks the exact same concept on a different note which is why I voted to close as a duplicate and if you look at the answers for your question and the other question, you'll see they are extremely similar in nature with the only difference being the exact note.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This was your edit that you made to your post:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I disagree that this question duplicates the question&lt;/em&gt; What does this note - B# - mean? &lt;em&gt;which concerns a different note in a different key&#xA;  played on an unspecified instrument not necessarily a piano, and&#xA;  probably not composed by Chopin.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The key is different yes, the note is different yes, the instrument is piano which is the same, and the composer is different. This is not why it was closed as a duplicate though as I said in a comment:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;It's the same concept on a different note that's why it's a duplicate.&#xA;  It's even the exact inverse scenario so it should be easy to see&#xA;  what's going on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The concept which was not addressed by your edit was the same. I rolled it back because the edit read more like a meta post then clarification for the question and adding details which is what the edit was suppose to be to get it reopened. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There have been other questions that were mainly about a topic already discussed that were closed as a duplicate, but later reopened after changing the focus of the question slightly. &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.stackexchange.com/posts/33706/revisions&quot;&gt;This question is one recent example&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If there is something that the other question does not address that you want answered (i.e. besides what a Cb is as that question covers the general concept of enharmonic equivalence which is what that question is), you can either edit your question to clarify that or ask a new one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="7222" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:41:38.193" LastActivityDate="2015-07-25T21:54:25.423" CommentCount="1" />

  <row Id="2273" PostTypeId="1" CreationDate="2015-09-10T12:33:51.960" Score="9" ViewCount="157" Body="&lt;p&gt;As your site is undergoing our new design-independent graduation process, you'll be enjoying your own run of design-independent Community Promotion Ads! &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;What are Community Promotion Ads?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Community Promotion Ads are community-vetted advertisements that will show up on the main site, in the right sidebar. The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;the site's twitter account &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;relevant music blogs and websites &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;resources for public domain sheet music and other materials &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;events, conferences, or meetups about musical topics &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;anything else your community would genuinely be interested in&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The goal is for future visitors to find out about &lt;em&gt;the stuff your community deems important&lt;/em&gt;. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are &lt;em&gt;relevant to your own community's interests&lt;/em&gt;, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Why do we reset the ads every year?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;How does it work?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The answers you post to this question &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;All answers should be in the exact form of:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]&#xA;&#xA;   [1]: http://image-url&#xA;   [2]: http://clickthrough-url &#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please &lt;strong&gt;do not add anything else to the body of the post&lt;/strong&gt;. If you want to discuss something, do it in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question must always be tagged with the magic &lt;a href=&quot;/questions/tagged/community-ads&quot; class=&quot;post-tag moderator-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;community-ads&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;community-ads&lt;/a&gt; tag. In addition to enabling the functionality of the advertisements, this tag also pre-fills the answer form with the above required form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Image requirements&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The image that you create must be &lt;strong&gt;220 x 250 pixels&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Must be hosted through our standard image uploader (imgur)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Must be GIF or PNG&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;No animated GIFs&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Absolute limit on file size of 40 KB&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If the background of the image is white, there must be a 1x1 border of not-white at the edges of the ad&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Score Threshold&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is a &lt;strong&gt;minimum score threshold&lt;/strong&gt; an answer must meet (currently &lt;strong&gt;6&lt;/strong&gt;) before it will be shown on the main site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can check out the ads that have met the threshold with basic click stats &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.meta.stackexchange.com/ads/display/2273&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1030" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-03-16T15:48:05.437" LastActivityDate="2015-09-13T14:33:00.180" Title="Community Promotion Ads - 2015" Tags="&lt;discussion&gt;&lt;community-ads&gt;" AnswerCount="4" CommentCount="0" FavoriteCount="0" />

The answer might be wrong, yes, but we have the up and down votes to determine which answers are good and which ones are not. A wrong answer is an answer nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Take it to the chat (or some Private Message, which I think mods have) and talk it over with him. If the flags are concerning comments that are too chatty, I'll refer the user to the chatroom. If the user is being aggressive and/or offensive, I'll try to explain that we need a friendly environment on the site and if the user doesn't realize that and keeps on offending people, I might consider suspension.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Generally, what I would do is to amicably ask the user to stop.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would talk it over with the mod.  I would explain why I disagree with their opinion, explain my own and see where that leads us. If we don't reach an agreement, we can always take it to the chatroom and/or the meta to see where the community stands.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;How do you plan to handle a situation where a (normal-avid) user of the site is dissatisfied with your moderation?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ask the user what they are dissatisfied about. Two reasonable people can reach an outcome satisfying to both, with a mature discussion. If what the user is dissatisfied about is reasonable I will try to change it; if not, I will try to explain what it is not.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;5&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;What criteria do or would you use to determine when an analysis question is too basic and/or specific and should be closed? For example, what reasons would you give for leaving &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.stackexchange.com/questions/39221/harmonic-analysis-of-the-b-section-of-have-you-met-miss-jones&quot;&gt;this question&lt;/a&gt; open and closing &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.stackexchange.com/questions/39067/need-help-figuring-out-what-time-signature-a-song-is&quot;&gt;this question&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Whether close an analysis question or leave it open, is pretty much up to the OP. The closed aforementioned example was a question that didn't show any research and is highly likely that it was a homework question. Moreover, it isn't a question that will last and will be helpful to others as well. &lt;sub&gt; I don't mean to say that it will be useless, but it won't be the most-searched question.&lt;/sub&gt; But a similar, more general question, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.stackexchange.com/questions/15102/how-to-tell-the-time-signature-of-a-song-by-listening&quot;&gt;How to tell the time signature of a song by listening?&lt;/a&gt; is something that a lot of people will need. It is something that a lot of musicians (especially new ones) need help with.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, concerning the question that was left open; we can see that OP has a good question, simply because he doesn't say &lt;code&gt;Tell me what is going on here!&lt;/code&gt;. He states that the progressions can be explained in some way (ii7-V7-IM7), but there is still some link missing between the 4 different progressions and wonders whether there is something more than an arbitrary connection. The link is something really really interesting and pretty complex, which deserves a question that is left open with a good answer, such as the one it already has.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;6&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;If you do not moderate on another SE site, do you have any experience moderating a community? Otherwise, if you moderate on other SE sites, how can you be sure that you will have time to moderate all of them? This SE site is currently growing and needs more moderation than before.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The truth is that I don't have much moderating experience to speak of. I've never moderated any SE site; over the last 8 years or so, I've moderated half a dozen forums, but small ones; nothing to speak highly of. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But for the last 2 years that I've been on this site, I've moderating it the way I can; the way the community can help the moderators out. I'm the top reviewer on all the review queues, one of the top editors and a few flags away from 500 (Marshal badge). This might count as a kind of experience.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;What one thing do you most wish were different about how Stack Exchange sites work (i.e., what feature would you add, remove, change, etc.)?

For instance, I would like to see questions like &lt;code&gt;What are some good books about jazz theory?&lt;/code&gt; etc. I know they are bound to be opinion based, but still up to a point, they will have subjectivity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Concerning this site, it would differ; like many users (including me) have mentioned on the meta, I would add some kind of musical notation to the specific SE site. It will not only help &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; writing answers but also the answers per se will be more easily read. The latter because a question that has notation, is much more beautiful that one that tries to explain it with words.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;8&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;What times of the day will you be most active?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I live in Greece, so the time zone is the Eastern European, UTC +2:00.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Generally, I am active most of the day. My PC is turned on for about 15 hours a day, and there is always a tab with this site on my browser. But, if I have to say which time of the day I will be more active, I will say during the morning and noon. This is because during the afternoon/night I have lessons, so there are days of the week that I won't be active on the afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;9&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;How much time of your day are you willing to spend on your moderators duties?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Like I mentioned above, most of the day my PC is turned on and I have a tab with this site on my browser. So, I can pretty much say that I'll be active most of the day.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;10&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Whilst Music Practice and Music Fans have different points of focus, there is an area of overlap between the two sites.

With regards to questions that fall into this grey area - although may be 'more suited' to one site or the other.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the question is on topic on both of the sites, why not leave it on the site that it was asked? It doesn't cause any harm.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Recently, I asked a question ( &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.stackexchange.com/questions/37844/will-a-marching-band-on-the-go-sound-out-of-tune-to-an-observer-due-to-the-doppl&quot;&gt;Will a marching band on the go sound out of tune to an observer due to the Doppler Effect?&lt;/a&gt; ) which was on topic here and would also be on topic on Physics.SE; it fell on the gray area. But it didn't cause any harm to leave it here  (and it received some good answers), so that is why the community didn't vote to move it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="7356" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:41:40.433" LastActivityDate="2015-11-17T06:47:05.390" CommentCount="1" />

They are frequently used for people misusing the answer space to ask questions, provide commentary on other answers, or make odd statements about other matters.  They are also sometimes used on &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt; answers, which is incorrect (that's what downvotes are for) and they should be declined in that case.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The only case that might present difficulty is when the post is an answer to a &lt;em&gt;different question&lt;/em&gt;.  In this case there are a number of things I would do:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Research the question and answer.  If I can learn about the subject matter well enough, I'll be able to tell whether the answer addresses the question.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If still unclear, I'd leave it for another moderator.  So far we've had great coverage of different concepts by the mods, such as Dr Mayhem making up for my lack of knowledge of guitar effects and NReilingh making up for my lack of knowledge of brass instruments.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If another mod can't handle it, we should consult the community via chat or Meta.  We have an incredible user base and I'm confident they could provide insight on virtually any subject.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Worst case, mark the flag &quot;helpful&quot; but take no action.  When something is on the fence, you decide in favor of the user &amp;mdash; both that the poster and flaggers were trying to be helpful.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We've actually had to deal with this a couple times on this site, with a range of outcomes.  Obviously the goal is always to resolve the problematic behavior and allow the user to continue contributing to the site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, we've had a few occasions where comments have spiralled out into extended discussions that get off-topic.  Usually it's enough to clean up the comments, preserving any that are useful and polite, and to leave a comment indicating the action taken and a mild admonishment of the behavior (rather than the users).  If that doesn't work and a particular user continues to engage in the same way, we escalate to a direct message (private mod messages provided through the site) and attempt to explain to the user directly what is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the behavior still continues we have to make a judgment call about its severity.  If they're just misusing comments to get into deep discussion about something, it probably makes sense to continue cleanup and the gentle reminders.  But things like attacking/insulting other people are not acceptable on Stack Exchange, so in those cases we proceed to suspensions (accompanied by mod messages re-explaining the issue).  Suspensions to continue to increase in length if they are issued multiple times.  It's extremely rare for someone to need to be suspended permanently, but it's important that we don't allow them to drive away others that are or might be extremely valuable contributors themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once or twice there has been a clear and simple misunderstanding where the other mod misread what was being asked.  In that case it suffices to revert the action and explain with a comment (and possibly alert the other mod to the action).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, we bring it up in our private moderator chatroom.  It's important to trust the other moderators and their judgment (and all my fellow mods thus far have definitely earned it).  So you want to establish their motivation and thinking.  Usually we can reach a consensus and proceed from there.  In borderline cases we, again, decide in favor of the user.  If we continue to disagree, but recognize that the other mod acted reasonably, we allow their action to stand.  Depending on the situation, it might be good to propose alternative actions to the user (rephrasing the question, posting on another site, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In a case of mod abuse I would contact the Community team at SE, but so far I've never had reason to so much as consider that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;How do you plan to handle a situation where a (normal-avid) user of the site is dissatisfied with your moderation?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's often a lesson to be taken when this happens.  Users here and on Android have made me aware of the fact that my moderation from mobile was often a bit hasty and I ought to leave a bit more explanation in comments regarding my actions, which was absolutely on-point.  In response, I've taken greater care when accessing the site on my phone and moved most of my moderation time to the desktop.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Frequently there's also a misunderstanding of site scope or the fundamentals of the SE platform.  Here I need to explain how things work, and that scope is ultimately up to the users &amp;mdash; not me or the other mods.  I'd direct them to Meta discussions or the Help Center as appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Otherwise it should be taken on a case-by-case basis.  Sometimes I can improve, they can improve, or we can agree to disagree.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;5&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;What criteria do or would you use to determine when an analysis question is too basic and/or specific and should be closed? For example, what reasons would you give for leaving &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.stackexchange.com/q/39221/28&quot;&gt;this question&lt;/a&gt; open and closing &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.stackexchange.com/q/39067/28&quot;&gt;this question&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For borderline questions, we should not close them. The community can decide via votes, and a mod should only step in if the community keeps oscilliating or arguing &amp;mdash; and generally decide in favor of the poster in that case. As for these specific examples, I think the outcome very clearly matches the wording of the close reason and not much interpretation was required.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's always a judgment call, and other than what's been outlined in the close reasons and the Meta discussions backing them I do not hold specific criteria.  It's always best when regular users come together and decide on a direction, and with the site's increasing size it's becoming less and less often that I need to decide myself about question closures.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;6&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;If you do not moderate on another SE site, do you have any experience moderating a community? Otherwise, if you moderate on other SE sites, how can you be sure that you will have time to moderate all of them? This SE site is currently growing and needs more moderation than before.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've moderated the Literature site (now defunct) and currently moderate the Android site, which is considerably larger than this one.  When it comes to moderation time, this site requires about a sixth of it.  Currently I have more than enough time to handle them and have zero concerns about that changing (actually I expect to have more time going forward).  However, if that changes I will be sure to alert SE and the other moderators so that we can make temporary adjustments or elect additional mods.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;What one thing do you most wish were different about how Stack Exchange sites work (i.e., what feature would you add, remove, change, etc.)?

It's obviously valuable to users, and as a mod it would make my life way easier to &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/243935/154510&quot;&gt;be able to find duplicates&lt;/a&gt;.  I also want &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/243654/154510&quot;&gt;a mod message template for low-quality answers&lt;/a&gt; so that I don't have to manually do it all the time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the past, I've helped champion &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/136956/154510&quot;&gt;the removal of the Accept Rate&lt;/a&gt; and a number of bug fixes (such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/103037/154510&quot;&gt;improper rate-limiting&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for this site, it would be great to have a general notation plugin; this is probably the most-requested feature by users of this site.  It would also be nice for the rich text bar to have a short list of musical symbols (sharp/flat etc.) so that people don't need to look up the Unicode characters or HTML codes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;8&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;What times of the day will you be most active?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I typically moderate a bit in the morning and again in the early evening, Eastern Time, with occasional spurts in the afternoon and late evening.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;9&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;How much time of your day are you willing to spend on your moderators duties?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Currently, as much as is needed and more &amp;mdash; I've often lead tag clean-ups and other activities outside typical moderator duties.  See #6 for more on my time constraints (or lack thereof).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;10&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Whilst Music Practice and Music Fans have different points of focus, there is an area of overlap between the two sites.

With regards to questions that fall into this grey area - although may be 'more suited' to one site or the other.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think the grey area is very small, to be honest.  Like English is to the US and Canada, music is a common language between our sites but there is still a clear and well-defined border.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As far as I'm aware, this issue has only had significant opposing opinions once (in &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2285/28&quot;&gt;this Meta post&lt;/a&gt;).  Dave's answer is excellent, and easily extended to any kind of question:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The linked question is off topic because it is a question from/about the audience side of the performance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;I can imagine applause related questions that are on topic because they come from the performer side. Performers may have questions with respect to managing their stage presence during applause, and these could be on topic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It would also be excellent to have Dom on board as a moderator here, since he is also a moderator there.  If there really was an issue in determining where a question belongs, I think he'd be best-equipped to handle it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="28" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:41:38.863" LastActivityDate="2015-11-16T21:40:23.097" CommentCount="0" />

If it still persisted, then more drastic measures would likely be necessary like the penalty box.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If I perceive it as an issue, I'll do what any other member of the site will do and bring it up in the meta for discussion for the community to talk about and see what the community wants. I'm a member of the community just like the other users and my views may not be the same as the rest of the community thus bringing the issue to the meta lets the community figure out what they want which is more than what one moderator wants.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;How do you plan to handle a situation where a (normal-avid) user of the site is dissatisfied with your moderation?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If this situation were to arise I would talk it over with the user via chat and possible have another moderator talk to and discuss it with them alone to give an independent view on the situation. I'm human I am prone to mistakes. If I am being ineffective, too harsh, etc. I would like to know so I can correct any issues.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;5&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;What criteria do or would you use to determine when an analysis question is too basic and/or specific and should be closed? For&#xA;  example, what reasons would you give for leaving this question open&#xA;  and closing this question?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Questions on analysis should be insightful and be what analysis is for which is the &quot;why&quot; in music.  Asking what chords are in this section, what time signature a song is in, or what key the song is in can typically be solved by just viewing the notation for the song thus are more like transcription in nature and form an analysis standpoint really only pertain to the one song so they are not allowed. However, questions like this that ask &quot;why&quot; like why is a D chord used in the key of C or why does this progression work tend to go deeper into what is going on and apply to much more than one given song.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;6&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;If you do not moderate on another SE site, do you have any experience moderating a community? Otherwise, if you moderate on other&#xA;  SE sites, how can you be sure that you will have time to moderate all&#xA;  of them? This SE site is currently growing and needs more moderation&#xA;  than before.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I moderate on the Music Fan SE. It's a very related site and has gave me a lot of moderation experiencing on a different SE so I understand what the position requires. The Music Fan SE workload for a mod isn't too bad and in my opinion will help here since if questions need to be migrated I can easily facilitate this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;What one thing do you most wish were different about how Stack Exchange sites work (i.e., what feature would you add, remove, change,&#xA;  etc.)? Would it be different if it had to be one feature or capability&#xA;  that would you most like to have for Music: Practice &amp;amp; Theory&#xA;  specifically?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We have the main site, the meta, and the chat which exists on every site. While the chat and meta together can kind of get the idea of community, I wish there was another way to build and interact with the communities on each SE instead kind of like a chat/meta hybrid where we can talk about the site and what we are doing together and keep track of it. For example, a lot of us are musicians and perform and having an area to post it and keep it around would be kind of cool besides just your profile or posting it in chat and hoping people see it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For this specific site however, notation is a must before then. It's way too often that I have to load up Finale to show an example of what I am talking about in notation. Also having some Analysis notation support like chord symbols and Roman Numerals would be great, but the standard notion takes priority.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;8&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;What times of the day will you be most active?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On a typical day, I will be active from 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM EST or 1:00 PM to 4:00 AM UTC. I'm most active in the evenings after 7:00 PM EST  and midday around 11:00 AM to 1:00 PM both EST. I do frequently check the site on my laptop and on my phone during my active times.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;9&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;How much time of your day are you willing to spend on your moderators duties?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As much as it takes within reason. I imagine eventually some days I'll only be able to moderate due to the number of flags and meta and on slower days when there is little to no flags I'll just participate like a normal user. Right now I spend a few hours a day  on the site and like I said I'll spend as much as I need to handle issues that arise on the site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;10&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Whilst Music Practice and Music Fans have different points of focus, there is an area of overlap between the two sites.

Whether it be Music Fans, this SE, or any other SE. Another thing to note is let's say a question asked here is off-topic here, but on-topic on the Music Fan SE.

If in doubt, however, I'd usually leave it unless I could see that the other mods had already reviewed and left it - in which case a quick chat in the mod room to gain consensus should be enough. Worst case, we leave it and see if the community raises more NAA flags, possibly dealing with it without mod intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First step would be to leave a quick comment, and try to guide the user through the Help page guidance. If that didn't work, a private message, followed up by suspensions if needed. The vast majority of individuals never need to get this far, though.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This has happened on occasion. Usually a quick chat with the other mod to understand the reasons. Depending on outcome, we may leave it as is or revert with a comment as to why. In either case, the meta route is always open for the community to discuss, as at the end of the day it should be the community decision unless something steps outside politeness/normal behaviour etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;How do you plan to handle a situation where a (normal-avid) user of the site is dissatisfied with your moderation?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This scenario has happened on this, and other sites I moderate. What we try to do is have the mod concerned step away from the activity, and one of the others step in to provide a more independent view. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;5&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;What criteria do or would you use to determine when an analysis question is too basic and/or specific and should be closed? For example, what reasons would you give for leaving this question open and closing this question?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This has been one of the biggest challenges for Music.SE, and the criteria have evolved along the way. Currently the simplest criterion is &lt;strong&gt;simplicity&lt;/strong&gt; - if a question could be answered simply by googling for the tablature or chords in a song, then it probably isn't suitable for analysis here. Similarly, an analysis question that applies only to one song is more likely to be closed than one that applies to a whole category of music.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;6&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;If you do not moderate on another SE site, do you have any experience moderating a community? Otherwise, if you moderate on other SE sites, how can you be sure that you will have time to moderate all of them? This SE site is currently growing and needs more moderation than before.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I currently moderate 7 sites including this one, so moving from pro-tem to elected mod will not change my moderating workload. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Contrary to what you believe, moderating actually gets easier as a site grows (really large sites such as SO are excepted from this!) and here on Music.SE we have an amazingly proactive community that really cares, so a lot of the work that a mod would typically pick up on a smaller site is actually handled by our high-rep community. So many times I get to a bad question only to find it closed successfully within a few minutes of posting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The good thing is - we already have routes to request more help if things do get frenetic. When a mod goes on holiday, we will let the others know if we are going to be scarce for a couple of weeks; and if the workload does creep up to unpleasant levels, SE typically bring in another election for more mods.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;What one thing do you most wish were different about how Stack Exchange sites work (i.e., what feature would you add, remove, change, etc.)?

Being able to embed YouTube is nice, but for proper analysis/description, notation in various forms is essential&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A Music.SE blog could help complete the information passing needs of the site&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;8&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;What times of the day will you be most active?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I live in the UK, so typically I get some time between 0630 and 0900, 1300 and 1400 and then 1900-2300, with additional checks throughout the day for flags etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;9&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;How much time of your day are you willing to spend on your moderators duties?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Currently I spend about 3 hours a day moderating across my 7 sites, but this ebbs and flows with each site's needs. Sometimes first thing in the morning is really easy, as any flags have been handled during my night-time.

In fact where there is doubt, we typically do check in the site-wide mods chat room to ask if they would like a question migrated.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Where the question would be perfectly valid here, my usual view is to leave it unless the OP or community vote otherwise.

The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;the site's twitter account &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;relevant music blogs and websites &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;resources for public domain sheet music and other materials &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;events, conferences, or meetups about musical topics &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;anything else your community would genuinely be interested in&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The goal is for future visitors to find out about &lt;em&gt;the stuff your community deems important&lt;/em&gt;. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are &lt;em&gt;relevant to your own community's interests&lt;/em&gt;, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Why do we reset the ads every year?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;How does it work?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The answers you post to this question &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;All answers should be in the exact form of:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]&#xA;&#xA;   [1]: http://image-url&#xA;   [2]: http://clickthrough-url &#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please &lt;strong&gt;do not add anything else to the body of the post&lt;/strong&gt;.

Click on either all question or all answers, then all actions, then comments.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, regarding mods in particular, they were all elected. During the election process, there are &quot;campaigns&quot; of a sort, including statements from the mods about why they think they should be mods and mod answers to user questions.

Look though the tag &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/composition&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;composition&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;composition&lt;/a&gt; should give someone an idea on what composition questions should look like.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In general, the composition questions here focus mostly on compositional techniques, styles, and strategies which are objective in nature. With composition and many other tags on our site like practice, performance, learning, musicology, and improvisation there's always going to be a little bit of objectiveness and opinionated answers due to the nature of the subject of music itself (after all, it's an art). So IMO it makes no sense to single out composition to have a specific guideline especially when we already have plenty of good objective questions and answers for composition already for others to point to for example.

If we answered any and all transcription questions, they would quickly become the majority of the questions and answers here. That would encourage people to come to Music.SE for transcriptions and at least that would heavily dilute the other content and users, more likely it would drive it and them out entirely.

More modern than baroque, but still solidly founded in theory.  We do get questions about every sort of music, but I'd say the bulk are about &quot;traditional&quot; and technical things &amp;mdash; theory and practice, as per the title.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;What is the experience level of the average community member?

Which makes sense &amp;mdash; they can't contribute much in answers, especially compared to &quot;experts&quot;; there's a lot in music that can't be mastered without extensive experience.  And with questions, learners will generally have lessons or some course of study that they're following and only pop in here rarely for a clarification.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anyways, to the point: Our active users are fairly advanced, and a good chunk of the total userbase is as well.

It's all &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;music&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Trying to divide it up into &quot;genres&quot; is counter-productive to learning to be a musician, in my opinion. Casual listeners of music seem obsessed with &quot;genres&quot; these days; musicians and music students, however, are &lt;em&gt;far less&lt;/em&gt; concerned with &quot;genres&quot;. One of the reasons the ancillary &quot;Music Fans&quot; site was created was to provide a place to migrate myriad questions by first-time posters with no reputation who ask the same kind of question: &quot;Here's a song I found on YouTube. What genre is it? Can you tell me the names of more artists in this genre?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;What is the experience level of the average community member? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On this site we have a small number of musicians and music students who post a great deal, but on the other hand the sad fact is that we have an endless flood of first-time posters with zero reputation who ask one clueless newbie question, get a few answers, and then never post another question again. The vast majority of these newbie questions are of very low quality and in many cases appear to be written by children or teenagers. That in itself is certainly &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a bad thing, but it also seems that most of these questioners are not themselves music students or musicians, and have a mostly-incoherent question that seems to be asked out of idle curiosity about this nebulous (to them) thing called &quot;music&quot;. They ask questions based on something they've read, but it's obvious from the question that they've never actually touched a musical instrument, so they frequently don't know what they are talking about and cannot phrase a sensible question. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then there are the questions from newbies with zero reputation along the lines of &quot;I want to learn to sing or play the (insert name of instrument here). How can I do that by reading about it on the Web?&quot; and all of us experienced participants give the same answer: &quot;Pay for lessons from a private teacher. Reading about it online or watching videos is not going to provide much help to a total beginner like yourself. First, you need personal lessons from a live human being to get started and establish some technique and some knowledge in the domain.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Would most describe themselves as beginners or experts&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I fear that, purely statistically, most users of this site would describe themselves as &lt;em&gt;non-musicians&lt;/em&gt;. These are often those that only post once and are never heard from again. We try to steer and migrate these people and their questions to the &quot;Music Fans&quot; beta site where their questions can be properly considered and answered.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But anybody on this site who post frequently (and there are thankfully enough of them to keep the site going) would describe themselves as somebody who is in constant learning mode -- and that is the &lt;em&gt;definition&lt;/em&gt; of a musician. Musicians are life-long learners who are constantly absorbing new information, developing more refined skills, and improving. In the wide world, without regard to StackExchange, I honestly know of few musicians at any level, even those with a doctoral degree, who would describe themselves as an &quot;expert&quot;.

So basically the level of the users is limited, the random users who came into this site is barely low, and regular users just keep asking hard questions for them to get some rep(s).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Would most describe themselves as beginners or experts (albeit as much&#xA;  as one can with music)?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Active members --&gt; experts (mostly)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Random members --&gt; some are experts, but mostly beginners.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Which musical trope(s) should be avoided?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid these:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/YMCsu.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/YMCsu.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/EyZOm.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/EyZOm.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Music is not always about that. Music is not about notations. Some musician don't use notation until the rest of their life. Music is an art. Art is about expression of your free soul.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Name one feeling you hope the community's design communicates to new&#xA;  users.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I can't name one, there's a lot of feelings for this community. @Patrx2 and @Shevliaskovic answers on this question is good enough. But here's mine:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THIS IS A COMMUNITY&lt;/strong&gt;. If you're serious about it, and you did ask something about it, &lt;strong&gt;give us a bookmark&lt;/strong&gt;. If you're just playing&#xA;  around just asking question you don't really care, and after you ask,&#xA;  you just leave it there, then f*ck off! This is like a bar, you came&#xA;  to it, we'll have a chat and discuss it together, like a family - not&#xA;  just like asking professionals or doctors. If you want to learn new&#xA;  shit everyday, then visit us everyday! We'll get discussions running&#xA;  all the time as long as we could! We're not just Q&amp;amp;A site for music,&#xA;  we're a forum, together we learn our shit and treat each other like&#xA;  family.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Pardon my language, because so many are just like that, ask a question and never check into it again - or treat the community just like a normal Q&amp;amp;A site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="9248" LastEditorUserId="9248" LastEditDate="2016-03-10T14:11:23.007" LastActivityDate="2016-03-10T14:11:23.007" CommentCount="2" />
  <row Id="2412" PostTypeId="2" ParentId="2404" CreationDate="2016-03-18T14:41:45.607" Score="3" Body="&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ul&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;If you had to select a music genre to describe community's feel, what would it be and why?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Like others have written, it doesn't feel right at all to try to answer this. As an active member of this community and as a fan, teacher, and player of more than one instrument and many genres, it seems to me that music theory and musical practice transcend genre. Music theory as a body of knowledge attempts to account for all kinds of music, and (to use an example) the practical techniques necessary for excellent piano playing are not genre-specific. In terms of theory, the major branch that I would call &quot;Western Functional Harmony&quot; is by far the most popular here, but that branch of theory is central to too many genres to pin it down.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ul&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;What is the experience level of the average community member? Would most describe themselves as beginners or experts (albeit as much as&#xA;  one can with music)?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that by &lt;em&gt;activity&lt;/em&gt;, a bit less than half of the questions, answers, and comments are posted by experienced musicians and professionals, and a bit less than half by beginners or those in their first few years. There are definitely several more intermediate people, who to me are the most exciting members because they are both asking good questions and coming up with fresh takes on answers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ul&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Which musical trope(s) should be avoided?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think my answer to this is &quot;all of them&quot;. By that I mean, if it screams &quot;Music!&quot; to non-musicians, it will probably seem hopelessly cliche and tired to most of the people here. That said, referring to ogerard's answer to &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/92/what-should-our-logo-and-site-design-look-like?lq=1&quot;&gt;this question on site design&lt;/a&gt;, I do feel like there are some things that are &lt;em&gt;classic&lt;/em&gt; without being &lt;em&gt;cliche&lt;/em&gt;. In this case, I like the use of the five-lined staff as a background element and the G (treble) clef symbol is a widely used trope that still doesn't feel overdone to me. The sharp and flat symbols being incorporated into upvote and downvote buttons would make me very happy, also.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, I think appropriately using &lt;em&gt;accurately&lt;/em&gt;-depicted elements of musical notation is at the very least a good starting point for ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ul&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Name one feeling you hope the community's design communicates to new users.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm really at a loss to answer this in words, but maybe examples will help. I really like the designs of these other stacks:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://math.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;Mathematics&lt;/a&gt; is probably my favorite (I am biased, though). Clean, easy to read, focused on asking and answering and presentation of information. But it's not austere. The grid background and the logo are mathematical without being too busy, cliche, or obscure; as are the basic geometric shapes used for badge icons.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://scifi.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;Science Fiction &amp;amp; Fantasy&lt;/a&gt; could be seen as very busy, but it actually works great. The black border and background art at the top make the whole page feel kind of like being on a spaceship bridge with a panaromaic view. The logo is kind of trying to cram too much into too small a space, but it still feels appropriate in the hot questions list. The fonts and colors are interesting and readable, and the little touch of badge logos being the symbol of the Rebel Alliance from &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; is icing on the cake.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://english.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;ELU&lt;/a&gt; is another great one. The background color is like the pages of old books, and the site logo is cleverly included in the name of the site.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://aviation.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;Aviation&lt;/a&gt; is almost too basic. Then again, that is appropriate for that stack. Communication in aviation must be concise, clear, and consistent or lives are put at risk. To me this design reflects the community it represents.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ones that I like less:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://networkengineering.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;Network Engineering&lt;/a&gt; has a logo concept that is a perfect representation of the site (it's the icon used by Cisco to represent a router), but the attempt to make the logo multicolored and the size limitations cause the logo to be too small and cryptic unless you really look at it and already know what you're seeing. Somehow the background at the top of the page comes off as unwelcoming, perhaps because of the dark colors.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://serverfault.com/&quot;&gt;Server Fault&lt;/a&gt; might win my personal award of biggest gap between stack content quality and design quality. It's a great stack but possibly the least easy on the eyes (or maybe just my eyes). The logo is nice-looking but doesn't represent anything that I'm aware of (maybe the red is a fault indicator light). The indication on the question list of whether one of the answers is accepted seems 100% backwards to me (the dotted border is &lt;strong&gt;green&lt;/strong&gt; when there's &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; an accepted answer).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of all the ones above, the one that &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt; most like what I think this site should feel like is ELU. Notation, writing, books, paper - these things are the hallmarks of all scholarship, including scholarship of music. No lives are on the line here, like Aviation, but we are dealing with an important method of communication. More challenging to me seems to be incorporating &lt;em&gt;practice&lt;/em&gt; into the design. On that front I note that the Science Fiction and Fantasy stack didn't bend over backwards to include fantasy elements into their design.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Overall, I like the idea of warm colors, but not very saturated. I think the five lines of musical staff notation make an excellent background element that instantly evokes music without being too busy or cliche.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So maybe after all of that, the feeling I'm thinking of is &lt;strong&gt;warm and inviting&lt;/strong&gt;. Like the music room in the home of a kindly older piano teacher who has an old grand piano with worn ivory on the keys and maybe that one Bb that sticks a little but it's otherwise a great piano and you can kind of smell the old spicy wood smell of the piano and it doesn't sound like a Steinway that you would hear in a major recording but you learned a lot playing that old piano and you hope it's somewhere right now being loved by a pianist.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="6070" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:59:54.087" LastActivityDate="2016-03-18T14:41:45.607" CommentCount="0" />

Based on your feedback, the following changes are being made to the design:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Logo&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A few people mentioned they read the logo as &quot;IMUSIC&quot; instead of MUSIC, so I've dropped the three bars before the wordmark. I'm okay with doing this because…&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;…the bars were initially placed there because most Stack Exchange community logos follow a favicon + wordmark format. It doesn't &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to follow this format. It's a guideline.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;…dropping the bars allows to shorten the length of the overall logo which was almost double the length of a typical logo.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;…dropping the bars allows us to create bring the community's name directly to the left-edge of the website.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;…and finally, I felt dropping the bars here were okay because we have the 12 bars to the right of the logo. The favicon still matches the logo.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/ooKmO.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/ooKmO.png&quot; alt=&quot;Updated Logo&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also wanted to note that I did change the black and white key ordering based on &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2424/27072&quot;&gt;Todd Wilcox's suggestion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Color&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As you can see in the above image, I've also toned down the brightness of the yellow, bringing in more orange. Hopefully this should eliminate some of the green some were seeing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I will be working on making these changes to the new site design, which should launch hopefully this week. We do have a number of internal projects launching this week however, so at the work it will launch next week.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thank you again for your help and patience throughout this process.

First off, congratulations on your community moving out of beta!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Graduation and Your Site Design&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Graduation comes with a few perks. One of those perks is community-specific design, reflecting your unique theme, topic, and culture. Many elements will be altered to help make your site unique, while retaining common elements with Stack Exchange communities. These common elements help show you are part of the Stack Exchange network.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Design Concept&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2404/music-community-site-design-ideas-input-welcomed&quot;&gt;I posted a discussion thread&lt;/a&gt; to solicit ideas and inspiration from the community. First off, &lt;strong&gt;thank you for all your feedback!&lt;/strong&gt; It was very helpful in pointing me in a general direction I should explore, as well as making sure I avoided the typical clichés surrounding music. Here were a couple statements in particular that really helped…&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://music.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2406/27072&quot;&gt;If you were to look at the tags for specific styles you would find that the questions asked skew towards jazz, classical-music, and blues in that order…&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://music.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2408/27072&quot;&gt;Musicians are life-long learners who are constantly absorbing new information, developing more refined skills, and improving.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://music.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2409/27072&quot;&gt;Score excerpts are fine; pics of working musicians are fine. The music industry's stock tropes (the ones they use to market the &quot;glitz&quot;) should be avoided.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://music.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2412/27072&quot;&gt;…I think appropriately using accurately-depicted elements of musical notation is at the very least a good starting point for ideas.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://music.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2410/27072&quot;&gt;Music is not about notations. … Music is an art. Art is about expression of your free soul.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In particular that last statement resonated with me. I really wanted to explore a concept of music that communicated the vibrancy, energy, and passion found in music; yet doing so without being overly literal or cheesy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building Blocks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/xwpYb.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/xwpYb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Moodboard&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Given that &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/jazz&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;jazz&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;jazz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/classical-music&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;classical-music&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;classical-music&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/blues&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;blues&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;blues&lt;/a&gt; were some of the larger tags utilized, I became really interested in abstract and loose stylings found in mid-20th century jazz.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Color Scheme&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/UsGaV.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/UsGaV.png&quot; alt=&quot;Palette&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the color scheme, I chose a lively, warm palette. The yellows and purples pair well to create nice color range, utilizing bursts of a muted red to help draw attention when needed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Logo Concept&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This was a tough one. It was here that it was really, &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; easy to fall back to a musical cliché such as a musical note, sound wave, or even the use of sheet music. All of these didn't feel right. They complicated the mark too much. Drawing inspiration from the idea of showcasing &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; you use to play with (an instrument), I created a series of abstracted shapes that represent piano keys. These keys are encapsulate a gorgeous wide-display sans-serif typeface that echos early-20th century architecture in its geometric forms.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/8MgZY.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/8MgZY.png&quot; alt=&quot;Logo Concepts&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Swag&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/6g4Yf.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/6g4Yf.png&quot; alt=&quot;Swag&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Site Design&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the site design, I kept most of visual elements in the footer. Adding them into the header made the top area of the website rather distracting and took away from why people are here: to ask and answer questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/CqDoM.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/CqDoM.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Home Page Concept&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/QuGKe.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/QuGKe.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Question Page Concept&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I believe this design captures the unique theme and topic of your community. I'd love to hear your feedback. If there are no major design changes, I hope to launch the site design soon!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for for making this such a great community!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design Notes:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a musician and music-lover myself, I found working this site theme challenging, exciting, and inspiring. As with any time I'm designing, I find music is very helpful helping me overcome creative blocks and finding momentum once you've reached a design rhythm. Music helps me take a step back, gather my thoughts, and meditate. I don't normally share this, but given the community's focus I thought it would be interesting to provide a selection of tracks I found inspiring while designing this community's theme.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: All links are to Bandcamp pages unless otherwise noted.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Luke Howard Trio&lt;/strong&gt; — &lt;a href=&quot;http://music.lukehoward.com/track/atlases&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&quot;Atlases&quot;&lt;/a&gt;  from &lt;em&gt;The Electric Night Descends&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paul Desmond&lt;/strong&gt; — &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sO8_NGzO39g&amp;amp;list=PLHyky5SR7eidOfXrKE4hP3QLYYafqX4KU&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&quot;Bossa Antigua&quot;&lt;/a&gt; (YouTube) from &lt;em&gt;Bossa Antigua&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hackney Colliery Band&lt;/strong&gt; — &lt;a href=&quot;https://hackneycollieryband.bandcamp.com/track/pygmy-goats-2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&quot;Pygmy Goats&quot;&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;em&gt;self-titled debut&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dele Sosimi&lt;/strong&gt; — &lt;a href=&quot;https://delesosimi.bandcamp.com/track/where-we-want-be&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&quot;Where We Want Be&quot;&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;em&gt;You No Fit Touch Am&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We Lost The Sea&lt;/strong&gt; — &lt;a href=&quot;https://welostthesea.bandcamp.com/track/challenger-part-1-flight&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&quot;Challenger Part 1 - Flight&quot;&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;em&gt;Departure Songs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B.Visible&lt;/strong&gt; — &lt;a href=&quot;https://bvisible.bandcamp.com/track/bcn&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&quot;BCN&quot;&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;em&gt;Okulus Drift&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Angus MacRae&lt;/strong&gt; — &lt;a href=&quot;http://music.angusmacraemusic.com/track/falling&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&quot;Falling&quot;&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;em&gt;Awake EP&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Max Richter&lt;/strong&gt; — &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dX9zRqM8iQ&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&quot;Dream 13 (Minus Even)&quot;&lt;/a&gt; (YouTube) from &lt;em&gt;From Sleep&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daniel Hope&lt;/strong&gt; — &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9uV3eE3q40&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&quot;Drowning by Numbers: Trysting Fields&quot;&lt;/a&gt; (YouTube) from &lt;em&gt;Spheres&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Michael Jackson&lt;/strong&gt; — &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Y3dsAY_a_I&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&quot;Human Nature&quot;&lt;/a&gt; (YouTube) from &lt;em&gt;Thriller&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thanks again for making this such a great community!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="27072" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-03-16T15:48:05.437" LastActivityDate="2016-03-30T23:22:24.770" Title="Music.SE Site Design (With an updated logo and color!)"

I'm doing a little happy dance inside my head at that. Well done!&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What I feel could be tweaked:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The white/black keys/bars (marimba/xylophone/etc.) are really cool. Maybe they are not meant to actually evoke a piano layout, but based on the use of white and black, I think &quot;piano&quot; when I see them, and then I instantly notice that the white/black pattern is kind of random and not much like how piano keys are laid out. The pattern to the left of the word &quot;Music&quot; in the logo is fine, in fact I really like it as a section of the keyboard, since it's not cliche while still being accurate. The bars to the right of the word &quot;Music&quot; would be much more effective, IMHO, if it went:&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;w w b w b w w b w b w b&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That's one fewer bar, which also takes the number from 13 down to 12 and makes the bars spell out a full octave (and would remove any issues for superstitious people). It's a B to A# octave which is not the pattern one would normally see while at the same time being recognizable and interesting for people who know the piano keyboard. The &lt;strong&gt;w w b&lt;/strong&gt; pattern on the swag/logo is perfect. I love it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I like the colors a lot - except for the yellow. I think &lt;strong&gt;a&lt;/strong&gt; yellow is a good match for the other colors. To me the current yellow looks green and sickly. I'm fully aware that everyone's monitors and eyes and ambient lighting are different, so it's just one opinion. I have the impression of the broad categories of colors, yellows are hard to find that are good-looking in a wide range of situations. In this design, a yellow is the dominant color, which is nice in the sense of it being a warm color. This particular yellow kind of hurts my eyes - it's maybe a bit challenging for a color that is the first color we see and the color that occupies the most screen area (aside from white). At the same time, I don't really have a great idea for how I would change it. I would suggest something more tan, but that might not go with the color scheme. The dominant color could be switched to the blue, but that takes away the warmth of the site. Perhaps merely adding a touch of red or reducing green and desaturating the overall color a bit would help, but then we are dealing with yet another shade of yellow that might look worse some or many people. Maybe using the yellow in a smaller area just around the logo itself would make it matter less how it looks on different monitors.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Edit:&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I checked out the design on an iPad Air 2, and while the yellow looks a little better on there (work display is a Dell), it still could be better, IMHO. In the good column, I hadn't mentally processed the votes/answers/accepted/views part before now, and I like it. Clean and clear. The footer is even more awesome on the iPad (not sure why). What if instead of the yellow background at the top it's just a very desaturated copy of the footer? Ah, or the color used for the piano and the body of the saxophone in the footer is a much more pleasing color to my eyes for the header.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="6070" LastEditorUserId="6070" LastEditDate="2016-03-25T14:14:44.333" LastActivityDate="2016-03-25T14:14:44.333" CommentCount="1" />

In particular, the request for &lt;a href=&quot;http://lilypond.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Lilypond&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/913/decision-request-lilypond-support-from-the-se-developers/972#972&quot;&gt;very popular&lt;/a&gt;.

Which is great and for some of the questions here certainly relevant... however, if we're honest, &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; of the features would very seldom be used.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;The flip side of Lilypond's power is that it's hard to implement. It may well be &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt; to do it on a StackExchange site, but it evidently requires some serious work and willingness from the SE developers. As &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.meta.stackexchange.com/a/915/932&quot;&gt;Richard put it&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;SE Devs:&lt;/em&gt; ...What's Lily? How?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In particular: there seems to be a strong preference in the team to keep every site-specific extension &lt;em&gt;client-side&lt;/em&gt;, i.e. JavaScript only. But an implementation of Lilypond in Javascript hasn't turned up yet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(There is apparently a MediaWiki extension that can do Lilypond already, but it's server-side. &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/913/decision-request-lilypond-support-from-the-se-developers&quot;&gt;Has been brought up already&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Alternatives&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Lilypond may be clearly the most powerful music markup language, but it's not the only one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;MusicXML is easy to parse etc. and can in principle rival Lilypond feature-wise, but it would be unwieldy to write even for an experienced user, and probably not accessible at all for newbies.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vexflow.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;VexFlow&lt;/a&gt; looked quite promising, but the project site says &lt;em&gt;pre-pre-pre-alpha&lt;/em&gt; since five years. That doesn't seem reliable.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;ABC is a simple and concise markup language, that's able to create ordinary western staff notation. It has a JavaScript implementation, ABCjs, &lt;a href=&quot;http://drawthedots.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;you can try it out here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Why ABC now?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://music.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2188/poll-do-we-prefer-abc-or-lilypond-for-site-markdown&quot;&gt;A poll last year&lt;/a&gt; concluded that Lilypond is much more popular than ABC.

After all, we have html entities for typesetting accidentals (&amp;sharp;, &amp;flat;, &amp;natural;), so why not scale degrees? At the very least, if we can't mimic the hat-notation in the literature, should we create our own community standard for notating scale degrees?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;OTOH, would it even be desirable to have such a notation?

Why we name notes A-G is different to how the major scale came to be &amp;mdash; at least from an asker's perspective, since A-G consecutively forms a &lt;em&gt;minor&lt;/em&gt; scale.  (Personally, I also find the question and answers to be fine.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.stackexchange.com/q/43576/28&quot;&gt;https://music.stackexchange.com/q/43576/28&lt;/a&gt;, I am on the fence about whether it is a duplicate.  Making a scale out of 7 notes is different from why we use only 7 names for them, but I am not clear on whether that's what OP is actually asking.    The other mods can hopefully fill this in.  If it's that he doesn't understand octaves and so on, he should really be asking about that rather than proposing an odd alternative to what he doesn't understand and then challenging us to defend against it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;That information is clearly relevant and would form part of an answer, but can't in itself be a complete answer to the OP's question, because we don't know if the OP understands what a scale is, or how (or why) scales repeat over the octave - all of which he'd have to understand as well as the information presented in the suggested duplicates to clear up the question they actually asked.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I strongly disagree with this.  If OP doesn't understand &lt;em&gt;something else&lt;/em&gt;, then they can learn or ask about it.  It doesn't make an answer invalid to include information at a different level than the asker is ready for.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, if the OP were specifically asking for the basics then that'd be a different story.

That's not to say that they are therefore perfect, but a lot of thought went into them on the part of a lot of people, and I doubt many people will want to change at this point. How much the icon clearly indicates music was definitely part of the discussion.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not using two eighth notes anywhere&lt;/strong&gt; was also part of the discussion. So while that's more obvious, it is seen as &lt;strong&gt;too&lt;/strong&gt; obvious by the community.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The vast majority of the Stack Exchange site icons do not clearly indicate what the site in question is about. I mean really, find me a single SE site icon that someone who has never used SE could look at and accurately tell you what the site is about. Certainly not Science Fiction &amp;amp; Fantasy, Mathematics, Server Fault, Role Playing Games, The Workplace, etc. Personally, I don't understand what the Bicycles icon is supposed to be even though I know it's for the Bicycles site. At least you figured out the piano keys thing at some point for our icon.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Given the above, the icons are not meant to indicate what a site is about right away without knowing more - instead they are &lt;strong&gt;reminders&lt;/strong&gt; of which site is which. Pretty much right away (on the day of the rollout), I've found I don't have to think for a second to know I'm looking at the Music icon. For one thing, it's the only icon with anywhere near the amount of yellow that it has. You could blur the icons pretty fully and still tell which one is Music (as opposed to Mathematics versus Role Playing Games - which almost look the same unblurred!). The current icon is pretty... well... iconic when it comes to indicating this site.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;An important part of my musical equipment is my library of books, including sheet music, music theory, and acoustics. I never noticed the book thing until you pointed it out, but now that I see it, I think it makes the icon even &lt;strong&gt;more&lt;/strong&gt; perfect. Now the icon has double meaning of &lt;em&gt;performance&lt;/em&gt; with the piano keys and &lt;em&gt;scholarship&lt;/em&gt; with the books.

Genres exist not only due to the music that is made, but to many other marketable aspects such as image and location which takes away from the part which we care about and are about which is the music. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The second reason is most genres don't have clear cut definitions and  what a  band/artist  is sometimes left up to  interpetation.

Thankfully, LilyPond MWEs are (usually) nowhere near as complex as a TeX MWE, so we wouldn't need as complex a discussion as they do.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure the best way to implement this; this is, of course, where the community comes in. If the solution is to draft an explanation of what an MWE with examples, I would be happy to create such a document.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I recognize that LilyPond questions are relatively rare on this site, but I hope the response isn't &quot;the questions are rare, so we can just leave things as they are and deal with it.&quot; I worry that such a response could ultimately discourage other users from even trying to answer LilyPond questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="21766" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:41:38.863" LastActivityDate="2016-08-09T06:13:47.720" Title="Minimal Working Examples (MWEs) for LilyPond Questions" Tags="&lt;discussion&gt;&lt;asking-questions&gt;&lt;lilypond&gt;&lt;software&gt;" AnswerCount="0" CommentCount="5" />

For example, when I was writing lyrics for my own music I'd always go to several different venues such as poetry clubs and open mics, writing workshops,  and musical open mic nights. Each would look at the lyrics a different way and help shape and shed some light on areas of improvement and help take it more in the direction I'd want it to go. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We should be much more focused on this site on how to combine lyrics and music and techniques on doing so. One example of this would be the technique &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_painting&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;word painting&lt;/a&gt; where the music literally represents the lyrics being sung.

However, I don't think we should be (for example) only allowing questions about fitting words to a melody or rhythm, or enforcing other rules that assume that some apsect of music is more important than another.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="18896" LastActivityDate="2016-12-25T12:56:45.097" CommentCount="2" />

There are a lot of variables to what gets votes and what doesn't get votes, but we could definitely improve in our voting in general.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let me start out by saying that voting is a very important part of any SE. Looking at the overall community voting patterns yields results we can utilize and learn from especially when seeing where our strengths and weaknesses are on a site. We also should separate &quot;being mean&quot; from &quot;not having enough voting&quot;. Voting should not have much to to with being mean or being nice, the content should be the sole indicator on weather or not content is voted on. There will be zero vote questions and answers sometimes due to the quality of the content, but if we're missing voting on content that is a big problem we &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to address. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Comparing one site to another is always tricky for many reasons including different activity levels, different user bases, different objectives, ect..  For this reason looking at just raw numbers isn't very useful, but looking at ratios for gives a much better results.  Math and Music are very different in many of these fields so looking at more than just two will also help identify if there is a serious problem on the site. The next few graphs will compare three SEs, Math, Music, and Worldbuilding. Worldbuilding was chosen because it has a similar QA distribution slope to us along with having a comparable size. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Question/Answer Ratio&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first thing to look at in general is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://data.stackexchange.com/music/query/608103/ratio-of-question-votes-compared-to-answer-votes&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;question/answer vote ratio&lt;/a&gt; as it will give an good indicator of how our site compares to other regardless of the amount of votes cast. These graphs specifically show the question/answer ratio the past 52 weeks with the query that produced them being shown above.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Music SE QA Vote Ratio&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/ttqTQ.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/ttqTQ.png&quot; alt=&quot;Music SE QA Vote Ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Math SE QA Vote Ratio&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/15f7W.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/15f7W.png&quot; alt=&quot;Math SE QA Vote Ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Worldbuilding SE QA Vote Ratio&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/LupFK.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/LupFK.png&quot; alt=&quot;Worldbuilding SE QA Vote Ratio&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While we do have a lower ratio in general compared to Math SE (besides for the 2 week spike), we have a higher ratio compared to Worldbuilding SE. Other SEs fall into similar ranges. This at least shows that compared to other SE's we split our votes between questions and answers similarly. This does not say conclusively though if we consistently vote on new content which&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Questions and Answers Per Week&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To gauge how well the ratio fits with the number of questions and answers per week, the number of questions and answers per week needed to be examined. &lt;a href=&quot;http://data.stackexchange.com/music/query/286061/questions-and-answers-per-week&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;This query looks at the raw number of questions and answers per week&lt;/a&gt;. I would have preferred a ratio like above, but I'd just rather get the results out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Music SE QA Vote Ratio&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/PjroM.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/PjroM.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;(TODO post graphs here and others)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Voting Data&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://data.stackexchange.com/music/query/483243/votes-per-week?Weeks=52#graph&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Looking at the raw voting data&lt;/a&gt;, one thing jumps out as a specifically is how the votes cast per week stack up to the actual number of questions and answers asked. While Music SE has about 2-3 ratio of question votes to questions per week, Worldbuilding has a 6-8 ratio. Math is comparable to Music in this aspect, but the sheer size and traffic of Math is much greater which shouldn't necessarily be the case in this situation. &lt;a href=&quot;http://data.stackexchange.com/music/query/edit/608637#resultSets&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Another query better outlines the issue of voting on this site&lt;/a&gt;. The results are suppose to show the top 200 voters in a year, but in our site we only have 153 above the threshold of 0.05 votes per day which is not a good stat. Those numbers translate to 1 vote every 20 day. Our highest is just under 5 votes per day and it drops off rather fast. The other sites have much higher votes per day which I think shows off the real issue which is we need people to vote.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(TODO post graphs here)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While this post is not complete yet and several more things should be looked into like new user question and answer posts per week and how many votes per week older questions and answers get, a basic pattern is starting to emerge which is &lt;em&gt;we as a community should be voting more&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="7222" LastActivityDate="2016-12-28T05:43:33.030" CommentCount="4" />

They tend to be much stricter there even compared to Music Practice/Theory. If you look at my record of questions, none of them were ever really particularly well-received and I started to develop a bit of an attitude. Frankly, people can be jerks, and there's no excuse for that. However, responding to &quot;jerky&quot; comments with other jerky comments (as I've done &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2612/is-it-ok-to-down-vote-because-of-poor-writing&quot;&gt;here as well&lt;/a&gt;) hurts your credibility. Usually, I find, when I allow my feelings to get in the way of actually focusing on the site topic, I'm not actually focusing on the site topic. And I get my feelings hurt.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A few things to remember:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Most of the people on SE are working professionals and have stuff to do. Nobody's here to babysit anyone else, and that sucked for me when I aspired to be a coder on Stack Overflow. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;We're all human, and sometimes people say stuff online that they wouldn't say to someone in person. If you've ever been online, you've said something you wouldn't say in person, almost as a rule. It's not good, or even excusable, but we all need to realize that in some way, shape or form, each of us is as guilty of abuse of anonymity as the next.  A little grace would go a long way, and realize that anonymity brings out the beast in all of us, even though in person we try to hide it. But grace is the important thing, because people will blow it even when they know they will ;-)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A lot of misunderstanding happens on the internet, and there's reason's why. First of all, the internet is where we go when it's the end of the day and we're tired (as it should be... The first fruits of our time ought to go to what we're being payed to do) so crabby, knee-jerk responses run rampant. Also, sometimes (a lot of times) intent is not carried through the text, so something that is meant to seem like a gentle correction comes across as a snarky, hot-headed, prideful reproof.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Stack Exchange actually really rocks. I've found that looking back on questions that I wrote which got closed or ill-received, it was because of my misunderstanding of Stack Exchange or the topic. Not the system's fault, actually, my fault. And whether or not people could be nicer to beginners is another question, and not specific to Stack Exchange (probably better here than at other places, depending on the stack)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for privileged bullies, all of the privileges on Stack Exchange are earned, which is what makes Stack Exchange rock. Not just any morons get to moderate. Moderators are selected by a vote, and, for the most part, are there &quot;for life&quot; (they're volunteers, of course). A lot of privileges are available to non-moderators, like you and me. Now, sometimes, just because we're opinionated, stupid humans, wrong decisions can be made. This isn't specific to Stack Exchange. However, when you have a problem with a way a specific issue was handled, Stack Exchange has the meta for discussion. Note &quot;specific issue.&quot; General questions (like this one) about people being mean and whatnot are generally not helpful. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In fact, if you have a complaint about a specific way a question or post was dealt with, by all means, ask away! That's why the meta exists. Most importantly, don't give up on the system too soon.

I've read and contributed to a number of online forums and this one seemed unusual:  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Upvoting/downvoting, editing other folks' posts, and the&#xA;reputation/privilege matrix DO exist on other sites, but not as&#xA;evidently as on this one.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I rarely see this level of effort to &lt;em&gt;control&lt;/em&gt; the Q&amp;amp;A.  Some corporate HR&#xA;sites, yeah, but not a public music forum.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In sixty years spent with creative musicians, we constantly discussed&#xA;purposes and philosophies (theories) of music. Despite the name, I don't find&#xA;that on this site.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The constant shibboleth of &quot;be civil&quot; recurs, but I didn't see real&#xA;concern about contributors' dignity.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, I pushed some buttons.  I answered a few questions, expanding the area I addressed each time. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I had written an old Amazon blog-post which I converted to Q&amp;amp;A, and through that I stumbled into the &quot;meta&quot;. &lt;em&gt;Holy Toledo!&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I essayed one more answer which technically met Tour &amp;amp; Help-Center guidelines, but purposely included discussion of individual musicians' concepts of music itself as well.

But this place does have its strengths - namely, the presentation of factual or at least somewhat objective information about music in a way that it doesn't get &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; choked by all the opinion, misinformation, nastiness and, indeed, pleasantries that you get on other internet sites. And I think some of that strength comes from some of the things you have (I think) highlighted as negative.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So... I think they / we are doing some things right. But there are things that could be done better (or even better) too. We could definitely do better at being friendlier to new users, IMO. Maybe we could do with a bit more actual music on the site.

And even the threshold for opinion based is quite broad compared to some of the IT sites. This does mean we do need to work with soft guidance on how the community flags, and how we respond to flags. Most of the community flags are responded to quickly, as in the past unhandled flags here have led to rapid escalations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Secondly, when migrating there are quite strict rules to adhere to. So if there is some doubt that the question meets topic requirements, our guidance is usually not to migrate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, answering in a comment is explicitly dissuaded. If a question is off topic, we should be closing or migrating. If it is on topic, answer in an answer post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This example, however, shows an intent to be helpful sort of getting stuck in between these rules.

The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;the site's twitter account&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;relevant music blogs and websites&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;resources for public domain sheet music and other materials&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;events, conferences, or meetups about musical topics&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;anything else your community would genuinely be interested in&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The goal is for future visitors to find out about &lt;em&gt;the stuff your community deems important&lt;/em&gt;. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are &lt;em&gt;relevant to your own community's interests&lt;/em&gt;, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Why do we reset the ads every year?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;How does it work?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The answers you post to this question &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;All answers should be in the exact form of:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]&#xA;&#xA;   [1]: http://image-url&#xA;   [2]: http://clickthrough-url &#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please &lt;strong&gt;do not add anything else to the body of the post&lt;/strong&gt;.

In addition to enabling the functionality of the advertisements, this tag also pre-fills the answer form with the above required form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Image requirements&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The image that you create must be 300 x 250 pixels, or double that if high DPI.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Must be hosted through our standard image uploader (imgur)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Must be GIF or PNG&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;No animated GIFs&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Absolute limit on file size of 150 KB&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If the background of the image is white or partially white, there must be a 1px border (2px if high DPI) surrounding it.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Score Threshold&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is a &lt;strong&gt;minimum score threshold&lt;/strong&gt; an answer must meet (currently &lt;strong&gt;6&lt;/strong&gt;) before it will be shown on the main site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can check out the ads that have met the threshold with basic click stats &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.meta.stackexchange.com/ads/display/2709&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1030" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-03-16T15:48:05.437" LastActivityDate="2017-03-21T15:34:28.463" Title="Community Promotion Ads - 2017" Tags="&lt;discussion&gt;&lt;community-ads&gt;" AnswerCount="2" CommentCount="0" />

So even if you think it is useless to downvote a really bad question from a a new user with no score yet (actually a score of 1 if you want to get technical), it helps in keeping the site free from questions that does not bring anything useful to the site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The SE system is programmed to auto-delete questions (and answers in some cases) without any action from any type of user, mod or network admin. This is done to clean up any non-useful questions or questions and answers which has been flagged as spam and abusive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If we look at points 8 and 9 in the linked meta post we will see the following&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;8&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system will automatically delete unlocked, unanswered questions that have negative score after 30 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system will automatically delete unlocked, unanswered questions with score of zero (or one if the owner is deleted), fewer than 1.5 views per day on average, and fewer than two comments after 365 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you take these into consideration, downvoting a bad question will have it removed in 30 days from the site, whereas it will normally take a full year to do so if question remains with a score of zero (this is, if these questions does not recieve any answers).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, questions does get auto-deleted by the system based on just the total score of the question without any user casting a close votes or being closed by the community or mod, provided that that specific question has not received any answers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Apart from this, as @Dom stated in a comment, 10K+ users can only cast delete votes on a question when that specific question has a negative score. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think we all should stop thinking that downvoting is there to punish a user, because it is not. It is a tool, if used properly, to keep the site clean from poor content or content that doen not fall in scope of the site. Some system or user cleanup actions can't happen if a question (or answer) is not downvoted. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As last thought, a downvote sometimes forces the poster to self-delete his own post or correct the post to bring it up to standard, and remember, downvotes can be removed if the post was edited in such a way to bring it up to scratch&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;EDIT&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The SE system also have an automatic answer/question ban system, if a user keeps on posting bad quality posts, and get enough downvoted, the system will apply a answer or question ban on the user, which again prohibit a user from posting anymore useless crap.

I've heard many electronics will work on Japanese power but some of them won't. What problems might I encounter with my synthesizers in Japan?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even though the concern is regarding the synthesizers, the question is &lt;strong&gt;about&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;electrical power&lt;/em&gt;. Yes, &lt;em&gt;maybe&lt;/em&gt; there are people here who know a lot about different synthesizers and who know a lot about power and maybe even have moved a bunch of synthesizers from the USA to Japan themselves. None of that changes that the questions is about electrical power.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, this question was about an operating system. Even though the asker uses many music-related applications that depend on the operating system, IMHO the operating system itself is not a music application. Many of us may use many music applications on the operating systems in question and have some knowledge, but that still doesn't change what the question is about.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, let's assume for a moment that the question is actually on topic. As far as I can see, there is only one way to answer it correctly, in a similar way to the sample question I came up with above. The only way to answer it would be to get a complete list of all the audio applications the asker is using and then attempt to run down how &quot;stable&quot; (which again, is a word with no clear meaning in this context - and my day job is in IT) each application would be expected to be on each operating system the asker is considering. Just like one would have to check the power requirements and compatibility for each of the 20 synthesizers to know whether it will work in Japan in our example question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To me, that's too broad. And even if it weren't too broad, we still don't have a list of all the music software the asker would want to use, so we have &quot;unclear what you're asking&quot; (essentially).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ok, now let's suppose that we've decided it's on-topic, it's (somehow) not too broad and we have a complete list of all the music software and hardware the asker wants to use and we have agreed on what it means to be &quot;stable&quot; (never crashes? only crashes once a year? what constitutes a crash? what about latency?), &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; somehow magically someone has gone to all the support web sites for all the software and hardware and vetted the eventual operating system and figured out which components will match the stability criteria we have established for which possible operating systems and has posted a textbook-sized answer that satisfies the asker.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's &lt;em&gt;no way&lt;/em&gt; someone isn't going to also answer with &quot;No, that whole textbook sized answer is wrong because I did this with my computer and it blew up/works great/whatever&quot; and &lt;strong&gt;now&lt;/strong&gt; it's primarily opinion-based! Really, it would end up being primarily personal-experience based, but for our purposes they amount to the same thing: a big argument over anecdotal evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, if someone can actually provide a solid, supported, effective answer to this question, then they would have reasonable standing to argue to re-open and they would be able to explain exactly why it's:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Music related&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Concisely and clearly answerable&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Not a matter for debate&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And if &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; person comes along and chimes in on this meta question, I'll totally consider voting to re-open, but I'll also have to avoid dying of shock because I just can't see how that's possible. And if someone were able to answer this, they wouldn't be too different from me! I use the same software the asker users, I use/have used the same operating systems the asker is asking about, my day job is supporting computers and making sure they are &quot;stable&quot; and querying vendors about compatibility, and I just generally know a lot about both technology and music.

This is part of why some of the piano questions seem OK despite being contrary to a literal reading of the on-topic guidelines.  (The other part of the good ones is that they are very focused on a relatively focused aspect of technique).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/113678/how-to-request-book-recommendations&quot;&gt;main problems that are brought up against resource requests are&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The utility/importance/desirability of the resources are going to change.&#xA;This is especially true for the more technology oriented Stack Exchanges, where today's standard reference becomes obsolete in a year or two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nature of the question promotes the construction of a list of answers, none of which is a the clear (objective) winner -- alternately you&#xA;could phrase it as any of a large number of possible answers would be equally applicable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a question manages to spell out all of the soft/subjective features of the OP's actual problem, you won't get a question that anybody else would find useful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I believe that for some aspects of music pedagogy/practice there might be a relatively small number of standard etudes or other resources that these kinds of questions could work.  This would mean that some resource requests would be acceptable on a case by case basis.  If we went this route it might be desireable to add a meta discussion along the lines of this &lt;a href=&quot;https://physics.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/4697/are-resource-recommendations-allowed?noredirect=1&amp;amp;lq=1&quot;&gt;Physics SE one&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One side effect of this might be the appearance of a bias towards classical music: it is my impression that in that field there is a more stable set of materials that are commonly used.  So when a guitarist comes here, and his/her resource request question gets shot down, they'll be able to point to all the apparently similar questions that were OK by this criterion.

As there are many issues with this question, all of them should be resolved before the question is reopened even if the close reason isn't the best for the current state of the question. Fixing the question should always come first.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Just because a similar question works it does not mean that the question works especially when it comes to what specifically what the question is asking. We do need general judgment from our users if a question is clear, too broad, or primarily opinion based as an on topic question can always suffer from these.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This case specifically, while the question may be a duplicate other issues plague it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Is it a duplicate?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With the given two sentences in the OP's question it's up in the air. The question is certainty &lt;em&gt;similar&lt;/em&gt; to the linked, but in the question's current state only the OP can say if it is or not.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Too broad/unclear&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These are together as there really is no detail in the question. If you take the question in the title &quot;What are the dimensions of piano keys, in inches?&quot; there's a lot to be desired. There are many different types of pianos and depending on if the OP is including electric pianos or keyboards there is a potential for a whole lot more. Even just talking about the dimensions of the keys on one piano, we aren't exactly sure what the OP means. The OP could just want the length or width or also the height or maybe they want to know about the inner potions of the key also. This is a lot of variables to play with and everyone answering could have a completely different interpretation of it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that the linked question is much more specific, but still the leading answer points to it being a broad topic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Low quality&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the current open/close status, the question is very low quality and as is not very useful to others as is right now due to the unclear reason above. It's not a reason to be closed alone, but it needs to be brought up when examining a question like this and when comparing it to other questions. Our tooltip to downvoting questions very much fits this question:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;This question does not show any research effort; it is unclear or not useful&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Whether you agree with that stance or not there's a reason that text is there. The OP and others will get as much out of the question as they put in and as of now there isn't much. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While previous research is not required, it helps fill in the gaps of what you already know and what you want to know. A quick search of of &quot;piano key dimensions&quot; brings a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.quadibloc.com/other/cnv05.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;resource&lt;/a&gt; that may answer the OPs question it may not. Including it in the question and either asking for more detail, for something similar but not the same, or if it was accurate would be much clearer to everyone and more useful to people who find that question. This is not saying the question can't be good quality, but things like this help a lot to improve the question quality.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;The question is salvageable, but it needs to be be edited by the OP&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even if it is a duplicate, we'll need the OP to confirm and then  we can clean it up for him and mark it as such. If the OP is asking a different question then we need to know. If the OP never comes back, then we're only guessing what they want and we should not try to change the question to something that we don't know.

The forum is filled with questions like 'When should I use B under C, C# D and A'. That's a little exaggerated, but that's how I feel. If this is a forum meant to answer esoteric questions then fine, but you are leaving out the majority of the users out there. Stack Overflow should be inclusive and answer those questions, but I feel that the answers they give are sorely lacking. The answers delve into theory that does not apply to them which, I feel, leaves the user completely intimidated and confused, and unwilling to ask any of their more pressing questions. It is ok to at least somewhat cater to pop, rock and rap. That is what most of the people who come to this site are looking for before they get scared away.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Maybe there just aren't the right questions being asked, but I've seen this on every other forum I've looked at.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Edit:&#xA;In case someone was thinking about adding modes as the same importance as chords and key signatures I'm going to add my opinion.

So while the close reason chosen was recommendation for specific equipment, it's just not a good fit for Music so other reasons could have been selected.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We do have a number of very good questions on production, and not just that small number tagged &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/production&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;production&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;production&lt;/a&gt; and some do even mention specific products, as if that is the only product that can do it, we probably have to name it :-)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My approach is to try and see whether the question is at the &quot;what is best tool for x&quot; end of things, which is always bad, and to do a check on whether it is actually a music related question (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/19487/154443&quot;&gt;Boat Programming&lt;/a&gt;) - in this instance I think it should have been on topic on Linux (but it appears not) and it actually received useful input on Sound Design.

In your case, you've requested off-site links that format the scales and fingerings in a printable form. It's not clear, for example, whether or not you already know all of the scales and fingerings and simply seek the information formatted for printing. This sort of request would be off topic and outside the goals of the site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is a way to rephrase your question so that it is &quot;on topic&quot; and fits within the specific rules of this site, but it may not be useful to you given your desire for something printable.

In particular, would this work:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;What is the technique that the drums and distorted guitar are using from 0:30 to 1:00 of this song? The meter is 4/4, and this meter is established by the intro guitar riff from 0:00 to 0:30. But at 0:30, the drums and second guitarist begin playing a figure that doesn't seem like it's in 4/4 time. The figure also doesn't seem to ever sync back up with the 4/4 time. How would music theory describe the rhythmic nature of this figure occurring from 0:30 to 1:00?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In edited form, this contains a clearer reference to a specific portion of a specific song, and it identifies a particular analytical aspect that the question is about. Additionally, I wouldn't call it a basic analysis question because it's about polymeter-&lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; figure (there are 3-3-5 groupings of eighth notes) which nonetheless deviates from a pure polymeter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Is this edited form on topic--does it meet the criteria for an analysis question about a specific song? Given the complexity of the passage, I don't think it's the case that &quot;a cursory read of any associated sheet music can give the answer&quot; (a criterion that user16935 described &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2091/40842&quot;&gt;in this post&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="40842" LastActivityDate="2017-07-05T03:47:53.130" Title="Closure: How is This in 4/4 (Question 58917)" Tags="&lt;discussion&gt;" AnswerCount="1" CommentCount="0" />

The answer you gave is really impressive and is a great value to the site, but wasn't really the original question. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We don't have a lot of rhythmic analysis questions here so talking about how they should be worded is important. If the OP agrees to your edit and wants to focus on the technique in the piece rather than just the piece itself it would be much closer to analysis than it was before. The title would also have to change to better reflect the kind of technique used so it can be more useful to users in the future as &quot;How is This in 4/4&quot; doesn't tell us anything about the meat of the question.

We've tried a bunch of different harmonizers, and none of them can handle the third and fourth octaves on the flute. In fact, most of them go into digital meltdown even in the second octave. We're reduced to using an octaver for voicing (using the POG2 with great results), but Forrest (my arranger/composer husband) would really like to utilize other interval combinations, including stacking them.&#xA;  We've tried a bunch of different ones, units up to like $1500 USD, but, despite the reps claiming they'll work, they don't. After getting the units shipped in to actually try them in studio, they fail at their job. Calls to the manufacturer then reveal that, no, they don't work in the soprano or high soprano ranges. Of course, they don't mention that in the specs! Another flutist/guitarist owned a VoiceLive3 and kindly tried it with his flute. It successfully went up to third octave G#, failing at third octave A. Unfortunately, it's no longer available and the manufacturer doesn't seem to offer anything similar to it.

But more specifically, it would allow other users to edit the score snippet I gave.  For example, if I made a typo (which I actually did), then another user could quite easily correct that.  Or alternatively, if I myself wanted to add to or modify the example I gave, if the source was included in the question it wouldn't rely on me being on the same computer, and having saved it somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So my question is, despite Lilypond not being natively supported by SE, is it still a good idea to include the source markup in the question.  And if so, how?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My first thought was to simply put it  in as a hidden comment, which only shows up when editing the source. I'm not sure this is possible though, as an HTML comment block (&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;!--&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;--&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;) doesn't work when the music snippet contains angle brackets.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Including the full source code in the question itself seems like overkill, as it would detract visually from the question and add unnecessary clutter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I suppose something like the below, while still outsourcing the code to an external host, is still an improvement on just a static image.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/nltRk.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&#xA;&lt;br&gt;&lt;sup&gt;source: &lt;a href=&quot;http://lilybin.com/qaymce/1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;http://lilybin.com/qaymce/1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://pastebin.com/zYmPJjYw&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://pastebin.com/zYmPJjYw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Do any of you have any opinions on what might be good standard practice for this.

If you are playing around with chords, just take the root, the third, or the 5th and substitute it with any other note in that scale and see what it sounds like. Ask yourself what does it feel like when you hear each one of those combinations. With enough ear training and practice, you should be able to play any combination of notes and make them sounds good. If you end up with a weird sounding chord, see if you can change a note or 2 and make it not weird again.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;You can use combinations/permutations in statistic to analyze it but I would not spend too much time on it. I would not try to make any mathematical formula for them either. The key is to play around with different combinations as much as possible until you get the sound and the expression that you want.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another user expressed disagreement with the first sentence, commenting that &quot;a chord does not have to be pleasing to the ear.&quot; Accordingly, the user edited the first sentence to remove the contentious part:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;A chord is pretty much any combination of&lt;s&gt; the&lt;/s&gt; notes&lt;s&gt; that sound pleasing to the ear&lt;/s&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It seems like the rest of the post reiterates the author's original idea that a chord must be pleasing:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&quot;see what it sounds like&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&quot;ask yourself what does it feel like&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&quot;you should be able to ... make them sound[] good&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&quot;change a note or 2 and make it not weird&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&quot;get the sound ... you want&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bich seems to be proposing a definition wherein a chord must sound good. At least, this was the original phrasing, and the following statements seem to reiterate and support that idea.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I disagree with the content of Bich's answer, and because of that disagreement, I think the edit actually improves the post. But whether I agree with Bich's content shouldn't be the basis of an edit, as I understand it. My understanding is that edits shouldn't depart from the original intent and shouldn't make changes to the content of the answer. I don't think Bich's original statement was &lt;em&gt;unclear&lt;/em&gt;--he seems to be saying something very specific (albeit wrong, in my opinion). Redacting it seems to change the meaning by deleting the controversial part.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the original user (Bich, in this case) always has the ability to roll back an edit. Moreover, the definition seems so blatantly wrong that a charitable reading might suggest Bich didn't truly &lt;em&gt;mean&lt;/em&gt; what he actually wrote. Are these reasons to make edits to correct very obvious errors in content? Is the edit appropriate in this case? I can see that removing glaring errors might improve the site, and I understand the desire to give a charitable reading--it's an important part of academia. I have refrained from making such edits to correct glaring errors. But if the original user can always roll back the edit, maybe these corrections are okay if they are aligned with a charitable reading? Or is it wrong under any circumstances to change the content, even if the original author may not mean what they say?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On further thought, the statement &quot;With enough ear training and practice, you should be able to play any combination of notes and make them sounds good&quot; seems very important, and I overlooked this initially. In stating this, the user expresses the idea that any combination of notes will sound good to a trained ear. So when Bich defines a chord as &quot;any combination of notes,&quot; the addendum &quot;that sound good&quot; is auxiliary because any combination of notes &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; sound good to a trained ear. Adding or removing &quot;that sound good&quot; doesn't change the meaning because it's implied throughout. Moreover, this isn't a fundamental distinction for Bich because any combination of notes should sound good with practice and training. The edit improves the post by removing a distraction which we can reasonably infer isn't fundamental to Bich's meaning.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="40842" LastEditorUserId="40842" LastEditDate="2017-11-19T15:02:28.707" LastActivityDate="2017-11-20T21:18:04.163" Title="Charitable interpretation vs. editing content" Tags="&lt;discussion&gt;" AnswerCount="2" CommentCount="1" />

For example, some musicians like to think about music in terms of scales and modes, while others don't. Some musicians find these categories useful, while others don't. These preferences are largely personal and subjective in nature, and one such preference isn't objectively better than another.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, some people find certain questions to be lacking in value. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.stackexchange.com/questions/64310/which-scales-can-i-use&quot;&gt;this question&lt;/a&gt; asks what scales to use when improvising over a particular chord progression:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What scale(s) can I use?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;I've just come back from my jazz workshop and the lines I played over a G7 C7 G7 D7#9 Eb7#9 D7#9b13 G7 progression were ok, -ish. When asked, our teacher told me to try dorian scales, over mixolydian and altered chords. What is your angle on this?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://music.stackexchange.com/questions/64310/which-scales-can-i-use/64315#64315&quot;&gt;This answer&lt;/a&gt; states:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;You're not really asking the right question! It's taking a narrow, inward-looking, mechanical approach to a wide topic - how to play good jazz.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;It's often a good idea to find a song using the chord sequence and see what the original melody was. That may well be the BEST thing to play over that sequence. And I bet is isn't just scales.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I wonder if this is an acceptable answer. Perhaps one would argue that this type of answer is fine when the asker explicitly states his/her &lt;em&gt;goal&lt;/em&gt;. In the example above, we can imagine the asker saying &quot;I want to improve my improvising, which is why I'm wondering what scales to use.&quot; If this were included in the question (or if it has been sufficiently implied), then perhaps it's acceptable to answer the question by saying, &quot;thinking about scales won't improve your improvising.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But this type of response amounts to commentary &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt; the question, not an answer &lt;em&gt;to&lt;/em&gt; the question. Answers that explain &quot;you're asking the wrong question&quot; are essentially arguing/asserting that the question lacks merit or value. (Then they often continue by answering a very different, far broader question like &quot;what will improve my improvising?&quot;) My understanding is that people who think a question is not valuable should downvote the question and perhaps leave a comment, not post their disagreement as an answer. The purpose of answers, as I understand, are to answer the stated question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Am I thinking about this the right way?

The moderators are compassionate people who care about maintaining a high quality of the site. They have a tough job filled with lots of negative interactions for which they receive very little (or no) thanks. Having a little positive interaction keeps them going through the tougher parts of the job, and we owe them a big thanks, as the site wouldn't run the same way without them.

When a moderator uses one to say &quot;thanks for your work over the year&quot; and assigns the bounty the max point value (500 pts), he/she appears to be extending the site's pre-created bounty function and effectively creating a secondary purpose: awarding users who do good work over a sustained period. We could imagine an extreme scenario where a moderator creates his/her own annual year-end award/prize, based on his/her own criteria. Would this extreme case be appropriate? Is a single bounty saying &quot;thanks for all of your great posts over the year&quot; appropriate? If I'm wrong about the site's intended use of bounties, please let me know--that would answer this question very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The site's philosophy is that moderators do &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.blog/2009/05/18/a-theory-of-moderation/&quot;&gt;&quot;as little as possible&quot;&lt;/a&gt;.

The initial response while, not being very descriptive, outlines the problem of trying to use the sound to describe the sound to others.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The purpose of Ear Training is to help you recognize things like intervals, rhythm, chords, ect, but it doesn't tell you what to hear or anything about what to perceive as consonant or dissonant. So while the student took the class and was able to tell a major chord from a minor chord, he was obviously not perceiving the major chord the same way as everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In general, any perception is in the eyes of the beholder. We carve out ideas of senses, but not the physical sensation. One more example is colors. Colors also have a very distinct roll in human perception, however, can you really answer the question &quot;What does red look like?&quot;. You can point to the hex code (#FF0000) or the first color of the rainbow, do you really experience the same red? Again different cultures group and perceive color differently.

I think the reason why the question might be difficult is that it seems to be based around one opinion given by one author; It may therefore be hard to give a good answer without venturing deep into opinion. However, if it really was &lt;strong&gt;well-documented&lt;/strong&gt; that Xenakis did want to cause pain, and this was a significant point in development of music, then this question could well be on-topic, because people could give more factually-based answers. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://music.stackexchange.com/questions/64526/is-xenakiss-dissonant-music-intended-to-express-his-personal-sufferings-and-tor&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is Xenakis's dissonant music intended to express his personal sufferings and torments?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Again this question is based around only one 'citable' critical opinion (the others you mention are from redditors), and again I think it comes down to &lt;strong&gt;depth of documentary evidence&lt;/strong&gt; - if there were interviews and other primary sources that could allow an answer to the question, then it could well be on-topic here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course there's a logical difficulty here in that it might be hard to know when asking a question what the depth of documentary evidence is. One possible solution to this is simply to leave a question open and unanswered, but Stack Exchange does encourage that sites ensure their open questions are answerable. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://music.stackexchange.com/questions/64551/how-does-ignoring-the-math-behind-xenakiss-cacophonously-dissonant-music-affec&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does ignoring the math behind Xenakis's cacophonously dissonant music, affect your reaction to it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a little bit like &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.stackexchange.com/questions/64777/how-can-a-layperson-in-2017-hear-the-perfect-fourth-as-dissonant-to-empathize-w&quot;&gt;your question on hearing the perfect fourth as dissonant&lt;/a&gt;, in that it seems to be primarily about using listening techniques in order to perceive music differently. This is an interesting area of question, but I think you might be ahead of the curve of human knowledge here - I'm not aware of a large body of accepted techniques for allowing one to hear or feel music differently, and hence it is probably true that at the current point in time 'answers to this question will tend to be almost entirely based on opinions', even if it's a reasonable question in itself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="18896" LastEditorUserId="18896" LastEditDate="2017-12-27T16:48:07.617" LastActivityDate="2017-12-27T16:48:07.617" CommentCount="2" />

This is not in itself a problem - Stack Exchange allows sites to choose for themselves how opinion-based is &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; opinion-based. (We're not the most opinion-based site on SE - something like &lt;a href=&quot;https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;Interpersonal Skills&lt;/a&gt; is even more... personal!).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As to exactly what is considered 'too opinion-based' here - as far as I recall, we haven't really tried to pin it down in writing. We tend to rely on close-voting to allow the user-base to decide on a case-by-case basis. The advantage of this is that each question can be considered on its merits. The disadvantage is that it can give a poor site experience for users whose questions are closed without them really understanding why. Personally I would be interested to know if we could try to define more clearly what we consider opinion-based, but it wouldn't be entirely straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;too broad&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a rule-of thumb, I reckon a question that's too broad is one that &lt;em&gt;can't&lt;/em&gt; be answered sensibly in a screen or two of text. &lt;strong&gt;I don't think that a question is too broad just because a long answer is possible - only if a short answer &lt;em&gt;isn't&lt;/em&gt; possible&lt;/strong&gt;. A recent example is &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.stackexchange.com/questions/65055/how-do-i-know-what-chord-progressions-to-use&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;how do I know what chord progressions to use&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - yes, you could consider that a full answer would require a whole book, at least. But the question is phrased in general, broad-brush-strokes terms, and so it seems sensible to answer in the same terms.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the most common types of genuinely &lt;em&gt;too broad&lt;/em&gt; questions is where someone has asked a number of distinct questions, each of which requires addressing separately. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;'what are the best'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://music.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/655/the-definition-of-opinion-based&quot;&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; question mentioned that 'What are the best' types of questions are considered too opinionated.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We have to be careful here - 'what's the best way to replace the damaged bridge on this instrument' might be a much more objective and answerable question than 'what's the best song from 1993'.

If there isn't already the answer here, then we want your question and answer here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All of this is assuming the question, while simple or basic, still complies with the guidelines in the help center&lt;/strong&gt;. No question that is a matter of opinion is on topic. Neither are questions about what the best product is or what product someone should buy. Also, simple &lt;em&gt;identification&lt;/em&gt; questions are usually off-topic, such as asking what key a song is in or what are the four chords in the bridge of a song.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It also helps &lt;strong&gt;a lot&lt;/strong&gt; to indicate with your question what thinking or searching you have done, great or small, and it's also good to make it as clear as possible what you will need to know to be satisfied with an answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An example of a low-quality, simple question:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;What's a quaver?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A better simple question:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;I've been playing by ear for a few years now and decided I'd better learn to read music. I just started reading guide to music notation and right on page one it talks about playing eight &quot;quavers&quot; per measure. I learned what a measure was back in grade school but when I do a web search for &quot;quaver&quot; I get a bunch of dictionary entries not related to music. What's a &quot;quaver&quot;?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;They are both dead simple questions, but the second one shows that you aren't just coming here and blindly asking every question that comes to mind as soon as you think of it. It's also understandable for an American (say) to be confused about &quot;quaver&quot; since in the USA it's called an &quot;eighth note&quot;, so a simple as the question is, it's reasonable to ask it here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, simplicity &lt;strong&gt;alone&lt;/strong&gt; does not make a question bad, any more than complexity alone makes it good. Do at least a little bit of searching on this site, maybe on the web in general and write a complete and detailed and on-topic question, and you should be fine. Come back to the meta if someone gives you a lot of trouble about your question(s) being overly simple or something like that when you know you've put in a bit of effort on them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="6070" LastActivityDate="2018-01-12T22:15:18.260" CommentCount="0" />

The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;the site's twitter account&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;relevant music blogs and websites&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;resources for public domain sheet music and other materials&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;events, conferences, or meetups about musical topics&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;anything else your community would genuinely be interested in&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The goal is for future visitors to find out about &lt;em&gt;the stuff your community deems important&lt;/em&gt;. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are &lt;em&gt;relevant to your own community's interests&lt;/em&gt;, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Why do we reset the ads every year?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;How does it work?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The answers you post to this question &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;All answers should be in the exact form of:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]&#xA;&#xA;   [1]: http://image-url&#xA;   [2]: http://clickthrough-url &#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please &lt;strong&gt;do not add anything else to the body of the post&lt;/strong&gt;.

Based on the OP's frame of reference and language there was no reason to believe they might not be including jazz under &quot;pop&quot;.

But they also changed to question to exclude jazz, which undercut my answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Same with half step modulations.  No comment all - they just added it after I answered to exclude what I had answered. IMO that's a miserable way to do things and I rolled back those edits.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The place to do that is in a comment: OP did that with jazz, but then also changed the question. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After all is said and done, my answer and also @PeterSchilling 's answer addressed the question square on.

While knowin what key a song is in is important, having a valid question of &quot;What key is X song in&quot; for &lt;em&gt;every single song&lt;/em&gt; creates a lot of noise and doesn't address the underling issue of learning how to identify the key of a song.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's many, many songs out there and there will be many, many new songs.

The question will only be useful for this specific song since the answer you are looking for only pertains to that song and as a site we would like to build a general knowledge of music rather than a specific especially when the questions on this specific topic (what key is a song in) is near infinite.

  <row Id="2952" PostTypeId="2" ParentId="2950" CreationDate="2018-03-28T17:45:23.003" Score="1" Body="&lt;p&gt;Firstly, my current rough understanding of what 'analysis' questions are allowed is - we don't allow anything where having 'the score' of the piece would answer the question. To be fair, I think the users of this site are fairly consistent in applying that idea - and hence the question you mention falls foul of that, because if you had 'the score', you'd be able to see what the key was, and the notes in each chord.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I put 'the score' in quotes there because, for many pieces of music, there isn't a good-quality score representation available. When I talked about this in SE chat before, IIRC we discovered that there wasn't a score readily available for about half of a random selection of popular works - so the logic of not allowing 'transcriptions' can't reasonably be based on the idea that a person could just get the score - as often that's not actually possible.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One reason that's sometimes given for not allowing transcription-type questions is that they wouldn't be useful to future readers. I don't think this argument necessarily holds up; wanting to know how to play an existing song is a common need amongst musicians; I imagine there are a lot more musicians who will want to know the chords to Kylie Minogue's Golden than want answers to some of the other questions asked on this site. At best, you might say that the usefulness will come down to the popularity of the song, but even then, people might be interested to come across new songs they haven't heard before.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another argument for allowing transcriptions is that stack exchange users are encouraged to&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Focus on questions about an actual problem you have faced. Include details about what you have tried and exactly what you are trying to do.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And &quot;I am trying to figure this out and I can't&quot; is very much along those lines. Sometimes on Music.SE we seem a bit leery of helping people with their real-world, individual problems; we seem to want to pay more attention to the very general purpose, 'library of answers' type question. And there is value in that, but there's also value in the specific. Sites like interpersonal skills and language sites are full of very personal questions that for whatever reason, many other users find value in. Sci-fi is full of story-identification questions that you might think would be useless to others, but they're often very well-received and appear in Hot Network Questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One area where I particularly agree with you is:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;To me, it seems arbitrary and, as we know, chord progressions are a fundamental part of popular music. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Absolutely. &quot;I have this audio and I want to work out what notes to play&quot; is just as much of a real and present problem for people doing music as &quot;I have this score and I want to do a roman numeral analysis&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's also the argument that the 'teach a man to fish' approach is more useful. In many cases, I agree - working out a key, for example, often isn't too tough, and we do already have some decent answers giving some good ideas how to do that. However, the &quot;teach a man to fish&quot; idea only has value if you actually do it, and I haven't actually seen any really good general answers on this site on how to work out chords. There are a few good bits of advice here and there but not much that I couldn't tell you, and I'm far from brilliant at working out chord progressions quickly. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's also the argument that we're not trying to replicate existing archives on the internet (or elsewhere) of musical transcriptions. Again, this is true - but that doesn't necessarily prevent us from stepping in where there is a problem with what's already available. I'd see that as analogous to a problem that SE language sites have - they want people to be able to ask about words, but not take the place of dictionaries. And I'm pretty sure they have ways to solve that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One possible argument for not providing transcriptions or parts thereof might be if there would be likely to be any legal issues. But the issues there would be the same as with reproducing transcriptions in questions for the purposes of more 'substantial' analysis, and that's not something I've heard any concern about.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That's probably enough rambling - Just some thoughts, and I'm not expecting to change many people's minds, so I won't go into any thoughts on how we could service these questions without devaluing the other content on the site.

This is not something that is unheard of and in fact has happened in the past to questions in a similar vein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Questions are vague what they are about until someone listens to the link, hence even well written questions will be hard to search the actual content of the question. So allowing these questions will add unsearchable questions to our library.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The questions are typically only useful to the user since the clip itself is the subject rather than the technique and there will always be more clips out there. This is also the typical reason for not allowing ID questions since the usefulness past the initial user is always questionable and there can be near infinite of them. So allowing these questions will take up a bulk of our content and only be useful for the asker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question's topic quality is innately low. If we were to allow this, a perfectly on topic question would be &quot;What is this technique?&quot;  with the post itself just contain a link and a time which is not a very high quality base for these types of questions. We &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; introduce minimum requirements to mitigated this, but there are on topic questions that need this that we are not doing so expanding the scope for questions with this innate problem will not improve site quality. (current example of quality problems can be seen in this quesiton &lt;a href=&quot;https://music.stackexchange.com/questions/69839/what-is-this-sound-effect-lady-gagas-monster?noredirect=1&quot;&gt;What is this sound effect? (Lady Gaga&amp;#39;s Monster)&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We can instead be helpful to the user by pointing them to the chat if they need it to be identified then ask an on-topic question about the technique if they still need help. This way we have users guide them to content that others have asked before or create new content if it does not. We're already having quality problems with on topic questions and adding more questions that will have similar problems is not a very good idea.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="7222" LastEditorUserId="7222" LastEditDate="2018-04-11T15:21:12.423" LastActivityDate="2018-04-11T15:21:12.423" CommentCount="16" />

If the operative word there is 'library', maybe we don't want to open the site to a potentially countless number of questions about a countless number of pieces..?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, we could read into that phrasing that we want to allow &quot;every question&quot; (where on-topic). That would be fair enough too - the worldbuilding site, for example, says that it aims to &quot;build a library of detailed answers to every question about worldbuilding&quot; - and that's an unlimited set.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So I think it's up to us what we regard as the long-term goals of the site. And arguably, because we allow analysis questions about (potentially) every song, we've already chosen the broader-minded view - that we're (in theory) happy with a potentially unlimited number of questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The point has been well-made that it's not necessarily as easy to search for these questions as some other types. And though this is true, I think there's still a whole range of ways in which people might find these questions...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Good descriptive titles that include the name of the work in question, and the technique (once we've identified it)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Tags&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;HNQs and the site homepage, for new questions&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;'similar questions', on the right hand bar&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;external links to the SO site, and external searches&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;User profiles&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So what would be the downsides? I think one problem that Dom pointed out is the site facilities - we don't have native video or sound embedding the way we can currently host pictures, and that's an impediment to asking and (especially) answering. One can imagine that with a site that can use your webcam to take a quick video on request, many questions could be answered easily.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately I think the most important thing would be the balance of the number of people interested in and able to answer these questions vs the number of people asking them. That balance is crucial and perhaps hard to assess while these questions aren't a major fixture on the site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One final thought is that in a few years, it may be that transcription software has progressed to the point that many music snippets can be substantially transcribed automatically. So it may be that if we hold off long enough, the demand will go away...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="18896" LastEditorUserId="18896" LastEditDate="2018-04-11T16:11:14.353" LastActivityDate="2018-04-11T16:11:14.353" CommentCount="6" />

If (as is most often the case) a sound is most straightforwardly produced with a particular class of equipment, then we can say so without needing to focus unnecessarily on particular makes and models, or allowing tedious 'what is the best'-type questions.

But....&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your comment that use of the Unicode code points may &quot;leave more room for error on the rendering side&quot; has caused me to think again about this. I use the Unicode characters all the time, but I have seen some users complain in the comments that the Unicode characters aren't rendering on their systems. Further, I have noticed that the Unicode characters seem to render as smaller characters, which are often not as legible as their simpler Latin alphabet approximations (especially on smaller screens). E.g. # vs ♯, b vs ♭, x vs , bb vs . I don't know how to best communicate a natural with a Latin character, but ♯ and ♮ can be difficult to distinguish, so it may be best to use # for sharp and ♮ for natural.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All of this to say that, upon reflection, I don't think that changing these symbols to their Unicode counterparts improves the clarity of a post, and it may even reduce clarity. I won't be accepting these edits any longer, and I may even go back to using Latin characters, except for naturals, in the interest of improved clarity and access.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="39614" LastActivityDate="2018-08-29T02:49:20.283" CommentCount="4" />
