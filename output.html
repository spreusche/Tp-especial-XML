               made a good mod, I think. Pity about the only 15% voters, but that's probably on par
               for a lot of elections.&lt;/p&gt;

               music, not for the general music consumer. The questions don't match the audience
               we have here. Not all SEs handle the same type of question the same way as the scope
               and the target audience for each is very different .&lt;/p&gt;
               
               &lt;p&gt;There is a &lt;a href="https://musicfans.stackexchange.com/"&gt;Music Fan Stack Exchange
               site&lt;/a&gt; that was made to bridge this gap.&lt;/p&gt;

            <td style="background-color:LightGrey;">&lt;p&gt;One way to look at the difference is that this isn't exactly "the Music community"
               of Stack Exchange. That's Music Fans. This is more like "the &lt;strong&gt;musician&lt;/strong&gt;
               community" of Stack Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;
               
               &lt;p&gt;Imagine if &lt;a href="https://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/"&gt;World Building&lt;/a&gt;
               allowed identification questions. It would not fit in with that site at all. World
               Building is in many ways the writer's community on Stack Exchange, and SF&amp;amp;F and
               Movies and TV are both fan-centered communities, again, like Music Fans for music.&lt;/p&gt;

               wants to listen to music, are completely different. For creative DJing you want variable
               speed, bidirectional needles, rapid start and stop, etc. For listening to records
               you need none of this.&lt;/p&gt;
               
               &lt;p&gt;This question is explicitly only about listening to music. Hence if you have an
               answer aimed at musicianship, you wouldn't be answering the question.&lt;/p&gt;
               
               &lt;p&gt;Hence, for me, it's off topic.&lt;/p&gt;
               
               &lt;p&gt;You might argue that a Hi-Fi is a tool for musical appreciation, and that musical
               appreciation is part of being a musician. But even in that case, this question is
               analogous to "my local library stocks musical scores -- how do I apply for a library
               card".&lt;/p&gt;
               
               &lt;p&gt;I'm surprised not to see a "home entertainment" SE, where this would fit fine.&lt;/p&gt;

               probably a JS implementation of Lilypond, is likely to be required, although having
               a &lt;a href="https://music.meta.stackexchange.com/q/264/104"&gt;basic set of musical characters&lt;/a&gt;
               to include in questions may also be useful.&lt;/p&gt;
               
               &lt;p&gt;And we already have some &lt;a href="https://music.meta.stackexchange.com/q/92/104"&gt;initial

               areas which wouldn't necessarily make it into a question/answer could be very useful
               to have on site.&lt;/p&gt;
               
               &lt;p&gt;Aside from that, I had a quick browse through the top 4 pages of meta questions
               and I can't see anything else that is critical (although anyone feel free to edit
               in any extras you think are important)&lt;/p&gt;

               &lt;p&gt;I think our DNA is in approaching music from a theoretical perspective--this is
               StackExchange after all, and education/learning relies on theory to be most effective
               whether you're a classical violinist or a bluegrass fiddler! So, I support the addition
               of the word "theory" to the site's name.&lt;/p&gt;
               
               &lt;p&gt;I also think this would be a good site name for the following reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
               
               &lt;ul&gt;
               &lt;li&gt;Could encourage more questions about theory and composition&lt;/li&gt;
               &lt;li&gt;Almost all of the site's scope can be considered in these terms&lt;/li&gt;
               &lt;li&gt;There's a bit of a play on words between "Music Theory", "Music Practice",
               and "Theory &amp;amp; Practice" being common terms on their own.&lt;/li&gt;
               &lt;li&gt;It fits with our chat room being named "The Practice Room"!&lt;/li&gt;
               &lt;/ul&gt;

               do you teach relative keys to new musicians?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; was close-voted as "Too
               Broad". A comment was made that:&lt;/p&gt;
               
               &lt;blockquote&gt;
               &lt;p&gt;a "how" question needs to set out some criteria, otherwise that's a purely subjective
               judgement.&lt;/p&gt;
               &lt;/blockquote&gt;
               
               &lt;p&gt;I'd suggest that ignores the inferences that a human being would usually make -
               e.g. that the question is asking for &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; ways to teach that topic, and that
               there are certain somewhat common assumptions that we can make about what 'good' teaching
               methods are (because we make those same assumptions on other questions about how to
               teach!)&lt;/p&gt;
               
               &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://music.stackexchange.com/questions/51947/what-is-the-diatonic-or-consonant-pentatonic-scale-to-play-over-a-major-chord-pr"&gt;
               &lt;strong&gt;Another recent one was originally worded "What are the best pentatonic scales
               to play over a major chord progression?"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This one has been close-voted
               as "Opinion based". &lt;/p&gt;
               
               &lt;p&gt;I can see that the phrase 'What are the best...' is always going to represent a
               somewhat Pavlovian stimulus to those aware of the "Opinion based" close reason, myself
               included! However, again, I think this is just a fairly natural human way of asking
               a common kind of "what scales fit" music theory question. In fact I wouldn't be surprised
               if the information needed wasn found in answers to other questions, but at least if
               we'd voted to close as a duplicate, we'd have pointed the asker &lt;em&gt;to&lt;/em&gt; at least
               one duplicate.&lt;/p&gt;
               
               &lt;p&gt;Perhaps I'm missing something, but in these cases, might we have judged the questions
               by rather 'inhuman' standards?&lt;/p&gt;
               
               &lt;p&gt;(I'm not trying to nit-pick unnecessarily based on just 2 questions; I think there
               are other similar examples that pop up now and again. The word 'recommendation' can
               often bring the close-vote vultures swooping too, for example, even when a question
               &lt;em&gt;isn't&lt;/em&gt; necessarily looking for recommendations for specific equipment).&lt;/p&gt;

            <td style="background-color:LightGrey;">&lt;p&gt;Well I can certainly understand that if someone stumbles across Music: Practice
               and Theory SE via a search engine such as Google, their first impression is going
               to be based on the quality of the question and answer they find.  &lt;/p&gt;
               
               &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Many of the questions and answers are excellent&lt;/strong&gt; and would be useful
               to a large number of people who could potentially "Google" the subject matter and
               land on a great resource.  That's what happened in my case.  &lt;strong&gt;I discovered
               this site through a Google search&lt;/strong&gt; and have found it to be very useful overall.
               Of course I have also seen many low quality questions as well as low quality answers.
               &lt;/p&gt;
               
               &lt;p&gt;Had my first impression been formed by reading one of these lower quality questions,
               then perhaps I would not have ever visited again.  &lt;/p&gt;
               
               &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I don't see how we can possibly avoid having some low quality questions
               and answers.  I think the best way to improve the quality of the posts on Music: Practice
               and Theory SE - is to &lt;strong&gt;encourage the active members of the community to be
               more pro-active in helping improve the quality by utilizing the tools provided to
               accomplish that goal.&lt;/strong&gt;  Specifically, down voting low quality answers, deleting
               inappropriate or potentially misleading answers, up voting good answers, editing questions
               and answers so they will make a better impression on the first time visitor and other
               tools available.  &lt;/p&gt;
               
               &lt;p&gt;After all, this is primarily a community managed site and depends heavily upon
               contribution from the members to be successful.  &lt;strong&gt;There are some members who
               regularly review&lt;/strong&gt; the questions and make edits and leave valuable comments
               encouraging the OP to improve their question or answer.  &lt;strong&gt;But more should be
               done to encourage these types of  quality control initiatives on a larger scale.&lt;/strong&gt;
               In other words, what can be done to enlist participation from more members?  &lt;/p&gt;
               
               &lt;p&gt;I am fairly new to the site and don't know much about the history of what has been
               tried in the past.  But one thing that comes to mind is if there was a way the moderators
               could reach out to some of the members who seem to have a history of high quality
               questions, answers and/or comments, and ask them to help in specific ways with the
               process of improving the overall quality of the content on the site.  &lt;/p&gt;
               
               &lt;p&gt;Recognizing that would be asking a great deal from the moderators to take on that
               task by themselves, I might suggest that the &lt;strong&gt;moderators could appoint a panel
               of special deputy moderators in charge of quality control&lt;/strong&gt;, who would be willing
               to participate and be empowered with the ability to reach out to individual members
               in some type of message system (or private chat) similar to what I imagine moderators
               can do now. &lt;/p&gt;
               
               &lt;p&gt;I feel we need to give these members an important sounding title to enhance their
               credibility.  In other words, I know if a moderator reaches out to me and ask for
               help on an issue, I will have a higher probability of commitment due to the respect
               I have for them simply based on their title as a "Moderator".  It's like "President",
               "Director", "Enforcement Officer", etc. Certain titles just command respect.   &lt;/p&gt;
               
               &lt;p&gt;My suggestion falls short of giving these "special deputies" (or whatever title
               we choose to bestow) any other power, other than as it relates to direct communication
               with individual members.  I would suggest that any members of such a QC panel, agree
               to participate in regular meetings in a special chat room where they could discuss
               the goals of the panel and ways they can use their position to help improve the site.
               &lt;/p&gt;
               
               &lt;p&gt;The first few meetings would be to define the mission statement and code of conduct
               and other guidelines that all could agree on.  If you would like me to help organize
               such a panel, I would be willing to help.   &lt;/p&gt;
               
               &lt;p&gt;I don't mean to suggest that such a panel would be solely responsible for the efforts
               to improve the content.  Rather the panel would be tasked to recruit more members
               of the community to help with the process of improving the site by reaching out to
               them and asking them to help.  &lt;/p&gt;

               practice and performance?&lt;/p&gt;
               
               &lt;p&gt;Black and white identification questions such as:&lt;/p&gt;
               
               &lt;ul&gt;
               &lt;li&gt;Who wrote this song?&lt;/li&gt;
               &lt;li&gt;What is this instrument?&lt;/li&gt;
               &lt;li&gt;What makes this sound? (With link to song / piece)&lt;/li&gt;
               &lt;li&gt;What should I buy?&lt;/li&gt;
               &lt;li&gt;Equipment recommendations / comparisons&lt;/li&gt;
               &lt;/ul&gt;
               
               &lt;p&gt;Are all likely to be unable to help future visitors as they are specific.  However,
               each of these questions can be recontextualized to fit the site and have larger appeal.
               For example:&lt;/p&gt;
               
               &lt;ul&gt;
               &lt;li&gt;How does this song fit in (or not) with this genre / time period?&lt;/li&gt;
               &lt;li&gt;How does this instrument fit in with this genre / time period?  Is it historically
               accurate?&lt;/li&gt;
               &lt;li&gt;How is this timbre / texture achieved in this piece of music?&lt;/li&gt;
               &lt;li&gt;Guidelines / advice for purchasing "&lt;strong&gt;_____&lt;/strong&gt;"&lt;/li&gt;
               &lt;/ul&gt;
               
               &lt;p&gt;The latter four questions all encourage elaboration and some discussion instead
               of mechanical one word answers like the above questions.  These questions also relate
               more to processes and application of concepts than merely identifying them.  With
               respect to purchasing guidelines, I personally support it as guidelines for instrument
               purchase can definitely be helpful to many other visitors.  However, comparing two
               distinct products is not.&lt;/p&gt;
               
               &lt;p&gt;I think if people took a few moments to consider their questions before posting,
               we wouldn't have to close so many questions.&lt;/p&gt;

               without attribution, and posted it to his own website.&lt;/p&gt;
               
               &lt;p&gt;I learned of this today when someone posted &lt;a href="https://music.stackexchange.com/a/16608/36"&gt;a
               new answer&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://music.stackexchange.com/q/1024/36"&gt;this question&lt;/a&gt;,
               to which I had posted &lt;a href="https://music.stackexchange.com/a/1025/36"&gt;an answer
               of my own&lt;/a&gt; on January 22, 2011 (the same day the question was asked). In the new
               answer, the poster makes reference to &lt;a href="http://normanmcandrew.com/music_tabs/Chord%20substitution.pdf"
               rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;an outside resource&lt;/a&gt; and observes that the outside resource
               contains (on page 4) the same material, verbatim, as my answer—as indeed it does,
               to my dismay.&lt;/p&gt;
               
               &lt;p&gt;Obviously, we're all volunteers here and our contributions aren't copyrighted.
               But in the interests of preserving my reputation and the reputation of my fellow contributors,
               I'm wondering whether these kinds of situations have come up before and how we can
               deal with them, if in fact we can deal with them at all.&lt;/p&gt;
               
               &lt;p&gt;Thanks, and here's hoping this isn't too common.&lt;/p&gt;

               could ABC notation be embedded in our posts&amp;#39; Markdown?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
               &lt;/blockquote&gt;
               
               &lt;hr&gt;
               
               &lt;p&gt;It's probably safe to say that everybody here would be glad if we finally got a
               proper way of typesetting music on this StackExchange.&lt;/p&gt;
               
               &lt;p&gt;Not that this hasn't been discussed earlier on meta. In particular, the request
               for &lt;a href="http://lilypond.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Lilypond&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href="https://music.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/913/decision-request-lilypond-support-from-the-se-developers/972#972"&gt;very
               popular&lt;/a&gt;. Lilypond offers fully-fledged, professional grade music typesetting,
               with any microtonality quirks you could possibly wish for. Which is great and for
               some of the questions here certainly relevant... however, if we're honest, &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt;
               of the features would very seldom be used.&lt;br&gt;
               The flip side of Lilypond's power is that it's hard to implement. It may well be &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt;
               to do it on a StackExchange site, but it evidently requires some serious work and
               willingness from the SE developers. As &lt;a href="https://music.meta.stackexchange.com/a/915/932"&gt;Richard
               put it&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
               
               &lt;blockquote&gt;
               &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;SE Devs:&lt;/em&gt; ...What's Lily? How?&lt;/p&gt;
               &lt;/blockquote&gt;
               
               &lt;p&gt;In particular: there seems to be a strong preference in the team to keep every
               site-specific extension &lt;em&gt;client-side&lt;/em&gt;, i.e. JavaScript only. But an implementation
               of Lilypond in Javascript hasn't turned up yet.&lt;/p&gt;
               
               &lt;p&gt;(There is apparently a MediaWiki extension that can do Lilypond already, but it's
               server-side. &lt;a href="https://music.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/913/decision-request-lilypond-support-from-the-se-developers"&gt;Has
               been brought up already&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
               
               &lt;h2&gt;Alternatives&lt;/h2&gt;
               
               &lt;p&gt;Lilypond may be clearly the most powerful music markup language, but it's not the
               only one.&lt;/p&gt;
               
               &lt;ul&gt;
               &lt;li&gt;MusicXML is easy to parse etc. and can in principle rival Lilypond feature-wise,
               but it would be unwieldy to write even for an experienced user, and probably not accessible
               at all for newbies.&lt;/li&gt;
               &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.vexflow.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;VexFlow&lt;/a&gt; looked
               quite promising, but the project site says &lt;em&gt;pre-pre-pre-alpha&lt;/em&gt; since five years.
               That doesn't seem reliable.&lt;/li&gt;
               &lt;li&gt;ABC is a simple and concise markup language, that's able to create ordinary western
               staff notation. It has a JavaScript implementation, ABCjs, &lt;a href="http://drawthedots.com/"
               rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;you can try it out here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
               &lt;/ul&gt;
               
               &lt;h2&gt;Why ABC now?&lt;/h2&gt;
               
               &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://music.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2188/poll-do-we-prefer-abc-or-lilypond-for-site-markdown"&gt;A
               poll last year&lt;/a&gt; concluded that Lilypond is much more popular than ABC. But this
               wasn't really news, Lilypond had already gained votes in a &lt;a href="https://music.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/870/will-a-music-markup-language-be-added-to-music-se-if-not-then-what-is-the-pref"&gt;earlier
               post&lt;/a&gt;s.&lt;/p&gt;
               
               &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it's still not here! The SE team has plenty of stuff to do, and
               apparently Lilypond doesn't fit in their plans. So, in the foreseeable time, the decision
               appears to be between&lt;/p&gt;
               
               &lt;ul&gt;
               &lt;li&gt;Decide that ABC (or some other Javascript-implemented language) is good enough
               and convince the developers to adopt it.&lt;/li&gt;
               &lt;li&gt;Just keep waiting, or pay some developers to implement Lilypond in JavaScript,
               or hope for a miracle or whatever.&lt;/li&gt;
               &lt;/ul&gt;
               
               &lt;p&gt;Would it be the sensible thing to settle on ABCjs, now?&lt;/p&gt;

               which prompted this question, is not a good one.  Even so, it's received several up-votes.&lt;/p&gt;
               
               &lt;p&gt;However I can imagine alternative ways of asking related questions like:&lt;/p&gt;
               
               &lt;ul&gt;
               &lt;li&gt;What are the traditional group structures for Indian trad. music, kind of like
               string-quartets?&lt;/li&gt;
               &lt;li&gt;What techniques/instruments are used in Indian trad. music to produce droning
               sounds?&lt;/li&gt;
               &lt;/ul&gt;
               
               &lt;p&gt;which would yield overall better answers while still providing the OP with the
               information he/she wants.&lt;/p&gt;
               
               &lt;p&gt;Just posting a picture/video and saying "What is this?",
               i.e. &lt;a href="https://music.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/310/asking-instrument-info-from-a-reference-material"&gt;Asking
               Instrument from Reference Material&lt;/a&gt;, is clearly bad; 
               however, it seems that with some guidance, some questions of this ilk could be made
               into good ones.&lt;/p&gt;
               
               &lt;p&gt;I have vague ideas that if the question is able to pull in something more substantive
               about the the sonic or performance characteristics of the instrument/equipment or
               the milleu in which it is used can make some "what is this instrument" questions valid,
               and useful.&lt;/p&gt;
               
               &lt;p&gt;Are there some guidelines that apply for making valid and useful instrument/equipment
               identification questions?&lt;/p&gt;

               here: &lt;a href="https://music.meta.stackexchange.com/q/854/7218"&gt;Criteria for allowed
               analysis of specific music&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
               
               &lt;p&gt;Analysis requests of specific works (time signature, harmony, etc) are currently
               not allowed in Music SE. I understand why: "Questions on identifying (or finding)
               a particular song, genre, instrument, etc. are off-topic since they are rarely useful
               to future readers." &lt;/p&gt;
               
               &lt;p&gt;I agree with this, but I also think this not necessarily applies to all works,
               and that we are letting that little con completely shut down a very big and interesting
               pro: the harmonic, objective,  analysis of well-known musical works and/or authors,
               that would be of the interest of a huge amount of people that would find it useful.
               Analysis of big songs, by big authors. (I know, what is "big", right? I think we can
               draw that line, bear with me)&lt;/p&gt;
               
               &lt;p&gt;We can either:&lt;/p&gt;
               
               &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1)&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Allow the analysis of all musical works. No exceptions.&lt;/strong&gt;
               We will get some questions with a very low interest amount, but what's the worst that
               could happen? Some questions not being answered? I think that's a very low "price"
               to pay for opening the possibility of analysis of works and/or composers that carry
               a lot of interest, that have the potential to generate great questions and answers.&lt;/p&gt;
               
               &lt;p&gt;The analysis of less-known works will always carry the potential of being useful
               to someone else anyway. &lt;/p&gt;
               
               &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) Allow the analysis of some musical works, based in a criteria set by
               the community.&lt;/strong&gt;
               If we think opening the valve completely is not a good idea, maybe we can open it
               just a little. We can set some rules. Here are some examples:&lt;/p&gt;
               
               &lt;ul&gt;
               &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create a community question once a week (or month, or every two days, or whatever)
               about the analysis of a specific work or author. We can vote and discuss the specifics
               of the question (which work, which author, etc).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
               &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allow analysis requests from only selected authors and/or eras and/or any other
               filter. Maybe allow common practice works only, or maybe only from specific authors,
               or whatever you can think of. Again, we can set and discuss the specifics here, in
               the meta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
               &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allow analysis requests only from users above X reputation (I know this is
               out of pattern with other SE sites, but it might not be a bad idea to implement it
               on this scenario).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
               &lt;/ul&gt;
               
               &lt;p&gt;This type of question will likely end up being on topic in the Music Fan SE Proposal,
               which is close to reach the commitment stage. I think it makes much more sense to
               have them here. &lt;/p&gt;
               
               &lt;p&gt;What do you think? &lt;/p&gt;

               to field (which I absolutely do not disagree with). An unfortunate consequence of
               that is that the guitars.SE community subsequently had no say in what questions were
               on or off topic (unless you were following both proposals of course).&lt;/p&gt;
               
               &lt;p&gt;Recently, there have been a rash of closings on questions that the moderators of
               music.SE believe to be off-topic here, but they were considered on-topic in guitars.
               The reasoning behind some of the closings where completely valid (shopping questions,
               etcetera), but others were simply closed as "off-topic." A good example of this is
               &lt;a href="https://music.stackexchange.com/questions/2778/powering-5-high-current-draw-effects-pedals"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;
               question. From what I gather, this question was labeled out-of-scope of the site,
               but I respectfully disagree. Questions related to how to set up pedalboards, amplifiers,
               and effects should most definitely be on-topic or you risk reducing the value of the
               site to the entire electric guitars community. Lots of folks have no clue how to properly
               build a pedalboard or how to change tubes in their amplifier so that they don't fry
               anything. I believe that questions like these have a lot of value, and shouldn't be
               discouraged just because they cross cut electro magnetics and circuit design. I think
               that the scope of music.SE should be revisited and changed to include topics such
               as these as valid.&lt;/p&gt;
               
               &lt;p&gt;Discuss.&lt;/p&gt;
               
               &lt;p&gt;(Note: If the community decides that these questions are off topic then I will
               respect that--I'm not attempting to start a "flame war," but I do believe that the
               guitars community content should be respected. We all worked hard on it.)&lt;/p&gt;

               not mean it is bad or not worthy of upvotes.&lt;/p&gt;
