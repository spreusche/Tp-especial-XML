The questions don't match the audience we have here. Not all SEs handle the same type of question the same way as the scope and the target audience for each is very different .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a &lt;a href="https://musicfans.stackexchange.com/"&gt;Music Fan Stack Exchange site&lt;/a&gt; that was made to bridge this gap.&lt;/p&gt;
</top_post></user><user Id="6070"><name>Todd Wilcox</name><location>Northern Virginia</location><reputation>32077</reputation><upVotes>319</upVotes><downVotes>20</downVotes><top_post>&lt;p&gt;One way to look at the difference is that this isn't exactly "the Music community" of Stack Exchange. That's Music Fans. This is more like "the &lt;strong&gt;musician&lt;/strong&gt; community" of Stack Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine if &lt;a href="https://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/"&gt;World Building&lt;/a&gt; allowed identification questions. It would not fit in with that site at all. World Building is in many ways the writer's community on Stack Exchange, and SF&amp;amp;F and Movies and TV are both fan-centered communities, again, like Music Fans for music.&lt;/p&gt;

For creative DJing you want variable speed, bidirectional needles, rapid start and stop, etc. For listening to records you need none of this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This question is explicitly only about listening to music. Hence if you have an answer aimed at musicianship, you wouldn't be answering the question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence, for me, it's off topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might argue that a Hi-Fi is a tool for musical appreciation, and that musical appreciation is part of being a musician. But even in that case, this question is analogous to "my local library stocks musical scores -- how do I apply for a library card".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm surprised not to see a "home entertainment" SE, where this would fit fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As per Chris's comment, &lt;a href="https://music.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2/104"&gt;some kind&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://music.meta.stackexchange.com/q/913/10938"&gt;music rendering&lt;/a&gt;, probably a JS implementation of Lilypond, is likely to be required, although having a &lt;a href="https://music.meta.stackexchange.com/q/264/104"&gt;basic set of musical characters&lt;/a&gt; to include in questions may also be useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we already have some &lt;a href="https://music.meta.stackexchange.com/q/92/104"&gt;initial thoughts on a logo&lt;/a&gt; - will need to be brought up to date etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also reckon a &lt;a href="https://music.meta.stackexchange.com/q/679/104"&gt;Music blog&lt;/a&gt; will be very useful - this is a very subjective topic, and many interesting areas which wouldn't necessarily make it into a question/answer could be very useful to have on site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from that, I had a quick browse through the top 4 pages of meta questions and I can't see anything else that is critical (although anyone feel free to edit in any extras you think are important)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think our DNA is in approaching music from a theoretical perspective--this is StackExchange after all, and education/learning relies on theory to be most effective whether you're a classical violinist or a bluegrass fiddler! So, I support the addition of the word "theory" to the site's name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also think this would be a good site name for the following reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Could encourage more questions about theory and composition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Almost all of the site's scope can be considered in these terms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There's a bit of a play on words between "Music Theory", "Music Practice",
and "Theory &amp;amp; Practice" being common terms on their own.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It fits with our chat room being named "The Practice Room"!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ask because, invariably, the answers tend to be something along the lines of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Well, we can't really say. You should get a teacher!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And thus our answers aren't real answers &lt;em&gt;per se&lt;/em&gt;. At what point should something like this be moved to the "questions not to ask" list?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; The most detailed answers along this track that I've found are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://music.stackexchange.com/questions/7540/how-do-i-determine-my-vocal-range"&gt;How do I determine my vocal range?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://music.stackexchange.com/questions/9381/what-is-the-process-by-which-singers-identify-their-voice-type-fach"&gt;What is the process by which singers identify their voice type/fach?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://music.stackexchange.com/questions/53591/whats-my-vocal-type"&gt;Whats my vocal type?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In light of Dan's very helpful suggestion, I'll let the moderator team decide if we need a new question/answer that incorporates information from all of these three threads.&lt;/p&gt;

</top_post></user><user Id="18896"><name>topo morto</name><location/><reputation>20828</reputation><upVotes>176</upVotes><downVotes>31</downVotes><top_post>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://music.stackexchange.com/questions/52144/how-do-you-teach-relative-keys-to-new-musicians"&gt;How do you teach relative keys to new musicians?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; was close-voted as "Too Broad". A comment was made that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;a "how" question needs to set out some criteria, otherwise that's a purely subjective judgement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd suggest that ignores the inferences that a human being would usually make - e.g. that the question is asking for &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; ways to teach that topic, and that there are certain somewhat common assumptions that we can make about what 'good' teaching methods are (because we make those same assumptions on other questions about how to teach!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://music.stackexchange.com/questions/51947/what-is-the-diatonic-or-consonant-pentatonic-scale-to-play-over-a-major-chord-pr"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Another recent one was originally worded "What are the best pentatonic scales to play over a major chord progression?"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This one has been close-voted as "Opinion based". &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can see that the phrase 'What are the best...' is always going to represent a somewhat Pavlovian stimulus to those aware of the "Opinion based" close reason, myself included! However, again, I think this is just a fairly natural human way of asking a common kind of "what scales fit" music theory question. In fact I wouldn't be surprised if the information needed wasn found in answers to other questions, but at least if we'd voted to close as a duplicate, we'd have pointed the asker &lt;em&gt;to&lt;/em&gt; at least one duplicate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps I'm missing something, but in these cases, might we have judged the questions by rather 'inhuman' standards?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I'm not trying to nit-pick unnecessarily based on just 2 questions; I think there are other similar examples that pop up now and again. The word 'recommendation' can often bring the close-vote vultures swooping too, for example, even when a question &lt;em&gt;isn't&lt;/em&gt; necessarily looking for recommendations for specific equipment).&lt;/p&gt;
</top_post></user><user Id="16897"><name>Rockin Cowboy</name><location>Atlanta, Georgia USA</location><reputation>20103</reputation><upVotes>7</upVotes><downVotes>1</downVotes><top_post>&lt;p&gt;Well I can certainly understand that if someone stumbles across Music: Practice and Theory SE via a search engine such as Google, their first impression is going to be based on the quality of the question and answer they find.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Many of the questions and answers are excellent&lt;/strong&gt; and would be useful to a large number of people who could potentially "Google" the subject matter and land on a great resource.  That's what happened in my case.  &lt;strong&gt;I discovered this site through a Google search&lt;/strong&gt; and have found it to be very useful overall.  Of course I have also seen many low quality questions as well as low quality answers.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had my first impression been formed by reading one of these lower quality questions, then perhaps I would not have ever visited again.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I don't see how we can possibly avoid having some low quality questions and answers.  I think the best way to improve the quality of the posts on Music: Practice and Theory SE - is to &lt;strong&gt;encourage the active members of the community to be more pro-active in helping improve the quality by utilizing the tools provided to accomplish that goal.&lt;/strong&gt;  Specifically, down voting low quality answers, deleting inappropriate or potentially misleading answers, up voting good answers, editing questions and answers so they will make a better impression on the first time visitor and other tools available.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all, this is primarily a community managed site and depends heavily upon contribution from the members to be successful.  &lt;strong&gt;There are some members who regularly review&lt;/strong&gt; the questions and make edits and leave valuable comments encouraging the OP to improve their question or answer.  &lt;strong&gt;But more should be done to encourage these types of  quality control initiatives on a larger scale.&lt;/strong&gt;  In other words, what can be done to enlist participation from more members?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am fairly new to the site and don't know much about the history of what has been tried in the past.  But one thing that comes to mind is if there was a way the moderators could reach out to some of the members who seem to have a history of high quality questions, answers and/or comments, and ask them to help in specific ways with the process of improving the overall quality of the content on the site.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recognizing that would be asking a great deal from the moderators to take on that task by themselves, I might suggest that the &lt;strong&gt;moderators could appoint a panel of special deputy moderators in charge of quality control&lt;/strong&gt;, who would be willing to participate and be empowered with the ability to reach out to individual members in some type of message system (or private chat) similar to what I imagine moderators can do now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel we need to give these members an important sounding title to enhance their credibility.  In other words, I know if a moderator reaches out to me and ask for help on an issue, I will have a higher probability of commitment due to the respect I have for them simply based on their title as a "Moderator".  It's like "President", "Director", "Enforcement Officer", etc. Certain titles just command respect.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My suggestion falls short of giving these "special deputies" (or whatever title we choose to bestow) any other power, other than as it relates to direct communication with individual members.  I would suggest that any members of such a QC panel, agree to participate in regular meetings in a special chat room where they could discuss the goals of the panel and ways they can use their position to help improve the site.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first few meetings would be to define the mission statement and code of conduct and other guidelines that all could agree on.  If you would like me to help organize such a panel, I would be willing to help.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don't mean to suggest that such a panel would be solely responsible for the efforts to improve the content.  Rather the panel would be tasked to recruit more members of the community to help with the process of improving the site by reaching out to them and asking them to help.  &lt;/p&gt;
</top_post></user><user Id="3518"><name>jjmusicnotes</name><location/><reputation>19770</reputation><upVotes>13</upVotes><downVotes>0</downVotes><top_post>&lt;p&gt;For me the answer is simple: does the question apply to broader themes of musical practice and performance?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Black and white identification questions such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who wrote this song?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is this instrument?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What makes this sound? (With link to song / piece)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What should I buy?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Equipment recommendations / comparisons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are all likely to be unable to help future visitors as they are specific.  However, each of these questions can be recontextualized to fit the site and have larger appeal.  For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does this song fit in (or not) with this genre / time period?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does this instrument fit in with this genre / time period?  Is it historically accurate?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How is this timbre / texture achieved in this piece of music?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Guidelines / advice for purchasing "&lt;strong&gt;_____&lt;/strong&gt;"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latter four questions all encourage elaboration and some discussion instead of mechanical one word answers like the above questions.  These questions also relate more to processes and application of concepts than merely identifying them.  With respect to purchasing guidelines, I personally support it as guidelines for instrument purchase can definitely be helpful to many other visitors.  However, comparing two distinct products is not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think if people took a few moments to consider their questions before posting, we wouldn't have to close so many questions.&lt;/p&gt;

Don't know if this is something we can have, or if we can have before the design along with our graduation, but it will the help the community a lot; writing posts would be much easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two discussions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned of this today when someone posted &lt;a href="https://music.stackexchange.com/a/16608/36"&gt;a new answer&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://music.stackexchange.com/q/1024/36"&gt;this question&lt;/a&gt;, to which I had posted &lt;a href="https://music.stackexchange.com/a/1025/36"&gt;an answer of my own&lt;/a&gt; on January 22, 2011 (the same day the question was asked). In the new answer, the poster makes reference to &lt;a href="http://normanmcandrew.com/music_tabs/Chord%20substitution.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;an outside resource&lt;/a&gt; and observes that the outside resource contains (on page 4) the same material, verbatim, as my answer—as indeed it does, to my dismay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, we're all volunteers here and our contributions aren't copyrighted. But in the interests of preserving my reputation and the reputation of my fellow contributors, I'm wondering whether these kinds of situations have come up before and how we can deal with them, if in fact we can deal with them at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks, and here's hoping this isn't too common.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please contribute to &lt;a href="https://music.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2490/28"&gt;Which questions/answers would most benefit from music markup like ABC?&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://music.meta.stackexchange.com/q/2507/28"&gt;How could ABC notation be embedded in our posts&amp;#39; Markdown?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's probably safe to say that everybody here would be glad if we finally got a proper way of typesetting music on this StackExchange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not that this hasn't been discussed earlier on meta. In particular, the request for &lt;a href="http://lilypond.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Lilypond&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href="https://music.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/913/decision-request-lilypond-support-from-the-se-developers/972#972"&gt;very popular&lt;/a&gt;. Lilypond offers fully-fledged, professional grade music typesetting, with any microtonality quirks you could possibly wish for. Which is great and for some of the questions here certainly relevant... however, if we're honest, &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; of the features would very seldom be used.&lt;br&gt;
The flip side of Lilypond's power is that it's hard to implement. It may well be &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt; to do it on a StackExchange site, but it evidently requires some serious work and willingness from the SE developers. As &lt;a href="https://music.meta.stackexchange.com/a/915/932"&gt;Richard put it&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;SE Devs:&lt;/em&gt; ...What's Lily? How?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular: there seems to be a strong preference in the team to keep every site-specific extension &lt;em&gt;client-side&lt;/em&gt;, i.e. JavaScript only. But an implementation of Lilypond in Javascript hasn't turned up yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(There is apparently a MediaWiki extension that can do Lilypond already, but it's server-side. &lt;a href="https://music.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/913/decision-request-lilypond-support-from-the-se-developers"&gt;Has been brought up already&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Alternatives&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lilypond may be clearly the most powerful music markup language, but it's not the only one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MusicXML is easy to parse etc. and can in principle rival Lilypond feature-wise, but it would be unwieldy to write even for an experienced user, and probably not accessible at all for newbies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.vexflow.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;VexFlow&lt;/a&gt; looked quite promising, but the project site says &lt;em&gt;pre-pre-pre-alpha&lt;/em&gt; since five years. That doesn't seem reliable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ABC is a simple and concise markup language, that's able to create ordinary western staff notation. It has a JavaScript implementation, ABCjs, &lt;a href="http://drawthedots.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;you can try it out here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why ABC now?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://music.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2188/poll-do-we-prefer-abc-or-lilypond-for-site-markdown"&gt;A poll last year&lt;/a&gt; concluded that Lilypond is much more popular than ABC. But this wasn't really news, Lilypond had already gained votes in a &lt;a href="https://music.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/870/will-a-music-markup-language-be-added-to-music-se-if-not-then-what-is-the-pref"&gt;earlier post&lt;/a&gt;s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it's still not here! The SE team has plenty of stuff to do, and apparently Lilypond doesn't fit in their plans. So, in the foreseeable time, the decision appears to be between&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decide that ABC (or some other Javascript-implemented language) is good enough and convince the developers to adopt it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Just keep waiting, or pay some developers to implement Lilypond in JavaScript, or hope for a miracle or whatever.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would it be the sensible thing to settle on ABCjs, now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm not as sure about instrument construction.  While there's certainly a large overlap, I would assume the majority of relevant questions are irrelevant to the average musician.  That said, I would have no problem with this site being host to them unless the &lt;a href="http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/21054/musical-instrument-construction-maintenance-and-repair"&gt;Musical Instrument Construction, Maintenance, and Repair&lt;/a&gt; proposal takes off.

Would it be useful to have, for example, "Sibelius (composer)" and "Sibelius (software)"? I haven't done any tag editing yet (not sure I can anyway), so just wondered how these tags would best be set up, and how the questions might then be reallocated. I'm guessing this is the opposite of the tag synonym process. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However I can imagine alternative ways of asking related questions like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the traditional group structures for Indian trad. music, kind of like string-quartets?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What techniques/instruments are used in Indian trad. music to produce droning sounds?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which would yield overall better answers while still providing the OP with the information he/she wants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just posting a picture/video and saying "What is this?",
  i.e. &lt;a href="https://music.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/310/asking-instrument-info-from-a-reference-material"&gt;Asking Instrument from Reference Material&lt;/a&gt;, is clearly bad; 
however, it seems that with some guidance, some questions of this ilk could be made into good ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have vague ideas that if the question is able to pull in something more substantive about the the sonic or performance characteristics of the instrument/equipment or the milleu in which it is used can make some "what is this instrument" questions valid, and useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are there some guidelines that apply for making valid and useful instrument/equipment identification questions?&lt;/p&gt;

</top_post></user><user Id="7218"><name>Rob</name><location/><reputation>10527</reputation><upVotes>410</upVotes><downVotes>84</downVotes><top_post>&lt;p&gt;(You can find the discussion about the criteria we could use to allow musical analysis here: &lt;a href="https://music.meta.stackexchange.com/q/854/7218"&gt;Criteria for allowed analysis of specific music&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysis requests of specific works (time signature, harmony, etc) are currently not allowed in Music SE. I understand why: "Questions on identifying (or finding) a particular song, genre, instrument, etc. are off-topic since they are rarely useful to future readers." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I agree with this, but I also think this not necessarily applies to all works, and that we are letting that little con completely shut down a very big and interesting pro: the harmonic, objective,  analysis of well-known musical works and/or authors, that would be of the interest of a huge amount of people that would find it useful. Analysis of big songs, by big authors. (I know, what is "big", right? I think we can draw that line, bear with me)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can either:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1)&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Allow the analysis of all musical works. No exceptions.&lt;/strong&gt; We will get some questions with a very low interest amount, but what's the worst that could happen? Some questions not being answered? I think that's a very low "price" to pay for opening the possibility of analysis of works and/or composers that carry a lot of interest, that have the potential to generate great questions and answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analysis of less-known works will always carry the potential of being useful to someone else anyway. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) Allow the analysis of some musical works, based in a criteria set by the community.&lt;/strong&gt;
If we think opening the valve completely is not a good idea, maybe we can open it just a little. We can set some rules. Here are some examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create a community question once a week (or month, or every two days, or whatever) about the analysis of a specific work or author. We can vote and discuss the specifics of the question (which work, which author, etc).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allow analysis requests from only selected authors and/or eras and/or any other filter. Maybe allow common practice works only, or maybe only from specific authors, or whatever you can think of. Again, we can set and discuss the specifics here, in the meta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allow analysis requests only from users above X reputation (I know this is out of pattern with other SE sites, but it might not be a bad idea to implement it on this scenario).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This type of question will likely end up being on topic in the Music Fan SE Proposal, which is close to reach the commitment stage. I think it makes much more sense to have them here. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you think? &lt;/p&gt;
</top_post></user><user Id="13"><name>Jduv</name><location>ATL</location><reputation>9334</reputation><upVotes>14</upVotes><downVotes>0</downVotes><top_post>&lt;p&gt;When guitars.SE was merged, music.SE had already decided what kinds of questions to field (which I absolutely do not disagree with). An unfortunate consequence of that is that the guitars.SE community subsequently had no say in what questions were on or off topic (unless you were following both proposals of course).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, there have been a rash of closings on questions that the moderators of music.SE believe to be off-topic here, but they were considered on-topic in guitars. The reasoning behind some of the closings where completely valid (shopping questions, etcetera), but others were simply closed as "off-topic." A good example of this is &lt;a href="https://music.stackexchange.com/questions/2778/powering-5-high-current-draw-effects-pedals"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; question. From what I gather, this question was labeled out-of-scope of the site, but I respectfully disagree. Questions related to how to set up pedalboards, amplifiers, and effects should most definitely be on-topic or you risk reducing the value of the site to the entire electric guitars community. Lots of folks have no clue how to properly build a pedalboard or how to change tubes in their amplifier so that they don't fry anything. I believe that questions like these have a lot of value, and shouldn't be discouraged just because they cross cut electro magnetics and circuit design. I think that the scope of music.SE should be revisited and changed to include topics such as these as valid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discuss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Note: If the community decides that these questions are off topic then I will respect that--I'm not attempting to start a "flame war," but I do believe that the guitars community content should be respected. We all worked hard on it.)&lt;/p&gt;

I am unlikely to use either solution in answers. But, ABC seems like a solution that could be implemented fairly quickly and would handle the general case. I vote ABC.&lt;/p&gt;

Bad questions can also have interesting answers that lead to the body of knowledge on this site expanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do think that we on this site is somewhat snobbish in how we upvote. Many of the highly rated questions are aimed at advanced issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These seem to be the question our experienced users find best but we should remind ourselves that just because the question is easy to answer or straightforward does not mean it is bad or not worthy of upvotes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all, our site is not just aimed at answering advanced questions&lt;/p&gt;
